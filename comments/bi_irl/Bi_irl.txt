Just like me fr fr


Based


Yes. Yes.


that image is goals tho


I just wanna look like that….


That's a bit forward, I think I'd rather do an enemies to friends, to semi-begrudging roommates, to complicated will they/won't they romcom potential paramours, to realize-they've-been-really-falling-for-each-other-this-whole-time drama, to an on-again/off-again clusterfuck of emotional turmoil that somehow stretches out for like 8 seasons


Bro just like me fr


bro is like me fr


That looks like me.


Peak r/196 content.


Who knows, who cares


They seem to have breasts and to be comfortable with that, so I'd say not male. They're most likely enby. Lots of nonbinary people and male crossdressers like to play guess my gender.
   Also, plz give credit to the artist if you know who they (the artist) are
  └─Male gender identity and female gender expression is also possible.
    └─Yes, but to grow breasts you need to either take or naturally produce estrogen. The great majority of AMAB people who do take it are nonbinary
       Assuming they are AMAB, of course
      └─There's a shirt there. We have no proof of grown breasts.
         I was just giving other possibilities is all, even if rarer.
         Entirely possible to be a trans man and not interested in binding or top surgery as well. I've known a couple of people like that. 
         Just lots of options. 
         And none of them would be a deal breaker.

Samezies


Some of you need a restraining order but I agree with most y'all


My friends: "So do you want to look masculine or feminine?"
   Me: "Yes."


Top or bottom?
  └─[deleted]
    └─Yes


Here we appreciate a little trolling.


Ass is Ass and hole is hole


if you look closely. you can see boobs, clearly female.
  └─Ah yes biology determines gender
    └─no, i was refering to body, and using the most simplistic terms possible, that would apply to the most people.
      └─Most likely a female, then, not clearly one. Boobs don't always equal women.
        └─true, these things are complex if you scratch below the surfice, but i often dont put to much thought into a comment on a meme.
          └─I mean yeah, hence why I corrected your oversimplification.
            └─or you could have left my single quickly made comment alone.
               and decided not fownvote all my replies.
              └─🤷‍♀️idk man dont need to be prissy about it
                 Also huh? I didn't downvote your replies wtf
                └─someone is downvoting my replies.
                  └─Well dude, it ain't me. Good day
