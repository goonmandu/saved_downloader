   My favorite panel is the last one, what’s in your heart is what matters most!
  └─There's a *couple* of little mini stories with these girls actually, the one where they run into eachother when the dark haired girl is being harassed by bullies floats around a lot on trans subs
     I didn't know about this one
    └─[It's actually all one big story.](https://m.imgur.com/a/BH3IHcZ)

😳😍🥰😊💘


uuh
   is this a trans woman admitting she is trans and the other girl says it doesn't matter, or is this a trans man, who hasn't transitioned, being gaslit (and somehow happy about it)??
  └─theres a few missing pages, its an amab person that knew the other girl since they were kids, shes just insecure about themselves which is why she says shes male and the other girl says shes a girl at heart and thats all that matters which makes her happy
  └─A trans woman.
  └─[Here's the full thing](https://m.imgur.com/a/BH3IHcZ), if you were wondering.
  └─Someone posted the link, she's trans fem


#Q_Q


There are pages missing. If you read it like this, it can be kind of not so wholesome even if the original is a beautiful story.   
   In this it looks like the girl is transmasc and being gently forced into a lesbian relationship while the original is pretty much the opposite.


Such cuteness!


My heart exploded . . . It’s gone now, the cuteness killed it


Holy shit this is wholesome


Damn why is this so wholesome my heart 🥺💜💜💜


Lesbian 🧡💕🖤🤎❤️‍🩹🤎🤎🧡💙💛❤️‍🩹🤎🖤💜🤎❤️‍🔥💗💔💔💞💞💞💙💘💛💞💕💓💖💛🖤💞💔❤️‍🔥💕💕❤️❤️


Love the story and I didn't even have to read a word.
