Yikes. No. Rule 8. The fuck y'all. This is an all ages subreddit.
   If I could temp ban every single person who upvoted this, I would.


Wth did I just looked at?
  └─Someone implying anal masturbation by getting notifications of responses that they are valid....
    └─There was a series of commercials in the 1990s that used this joke. 
       [https://youtu.be/sSvDilR8sLo](https://youtu.be/sSvDilR8sLo)
      └─Ads were fucking wild
        └─European ads are in a different tier. 
           I just think of the euro trip orange juice commercials lol. 
           Never forget America was founded by prudes so stuck up they got kicked out of the Church of England. We’re still dealing with the long-echoes of purity culture. (I mean, I know what sub I’m in, this ain’t news for any of us)
          └─They were definitely in the USA too. The $1.99 a month beeper company (super secret satellite around "Uranus") did one that was even weirder with the slobby guy at home telling his friend "beep me again" after his eyes cross 🤣  around when those salsa commercials were talking shiit about "New York City" lol.
          └─Look up "why can't we be friends Kim's", it's a pretty odd ad for Kim's which is a potato chips brand-thingy in Norway
  └─I'm sorry for its inappropriateness 🙈😭


They made the meme format into a full comic huh
  └─Now this, This is art!


I-
  └─You're valid
  └─you'r valid.
  └─You're valid 
     ^(\~vibrations\~)


Glacier_Clear for anyone looking for the artist, though Twitter is apparently dying so, be quick on that if you care
  └─Wait twitters dying? I dont have it myself but might get it later in life.
    └─Long story short, Elon Musk told the employees that there was gonna be some major heavy workloads ahead and that people who didn’t wanna work hard could take a 3 month severance and leave. About 75% of Twitter staff took him up on the second half of that offer. It’s extremely likely Twitter is gonna sink if they can’t restaff
    └─When Elon Musk bought Twitter, he fired half the workforce.
       Earlier this week he gave the remaining workers until 5 PM to sign a pledge to work for new "Hardcore" Twitter, involving much higher workloads and much longer hours, permanently, for no increase in pay.
       Anyone who didn't want to accept would receive 3 months severance pay.
       Most of the remaining workers at Twitter took the deal.
       It got so bad that Twitter closed its offices yesterday afternoon at about 6 PM and voided all access badges because they were afraid of disgruntled employees while they sort out who still works there and how many employees they actually have and what they do.
       There were reports of employees stuck in parking garages because their badges wouldn't let them raise the gates to leave the garage and facilities maintenance having to use a power saw to cut the gates of their parking garages.
       There seems to be a broad consensus that Twitter is dying rapidly under Musk's mismanagement.
  └─Trans community should make a new stronghold at Mastodon!! Leaving Twitter will make Elon seethe 😂 and literal billions loss for that insufferable prick.
     Trigger Warning: &gt;!He is (and has been) already (ideologically) aligned with LibsOfTikTok.!&lt;


I don't know how I feel replying to this one~~~
  └─🙈😵🥰🙏


This is funny as hell but I'm not sure if its appropriate for here
  └─absolutely 
     its so fucking funny because of how inappropriate it is
  └─It has the 18+ flair so I guess it's okay
  └─It's accurate.
  └─boa tarde compatriota
    └─boa tarde
  └─Then why all the upvotes
  └─That's what r/traansfw is for
  └─I feel like this sub has gotten a lot more horny over the last month or so.


Logistically this would be a nightmare. 
   First off, the phones been in the bum, I ain’t putting it near my face no more.
   Second, idk about you but my comments don’t give constant alerts. So it’s gonna be a buzz every few seconds. Maybe if it gets trending you might get bursts of a few buzzes, but not constant. 
   Thirdly, just get a vibrator. Much better and it’s got the intended purpose.
  └─Also I've never heard of a vibrator that is flat and wide. I don't think anybody has holes that are very embracing of the shape without a decent amount of preparation, effort, and pain tolerance.
    └─Ya I don’t want pancake poops.
      └─Oh god your comment reminded me of that ad for "poop molds" that you... poop through and... you get star shaped poop..
        └─Gross
          └─Yeah.
  └─🤦‍♀️
  └─&gt; Much better and it’s got the intended purpose.
     much easier to clean too
    └─Facts
  └─🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓 /lh


I know someone who would certainly like that


Fine I am valid.  I dont want any of this sexual stuff, let me enjoy my garlic bread and knots.
  └─100% agree
     Edit: to be fair they did mark it NSFW
    └─I am not a wise woman
      └─Curiosity got the better of me too XD
    └─Twice actually, but borderline, I know! hehe
  └─I'm still interested in sex, but after realizing about myself last year and being a year on hormones I do not miss the monkey in the back of my head screening at me to get off all the time.
     This kind of stuff always kind of weirded me out though.


LMAOOO


I unabashedly love this.


🤨


Everyone is talking about this is logistically impossible/really down bad but I just want her thighs.
  └─same she gives me such gender envy


😳😳😳😳


Weird question for anyone who has started hrt already, does anal feel any different/better after being in hrt? Or does it feel the same?
  └─I can guarantee you that a majority of cis men are not aware of the magical body part which is THE PROSTATE == LITERAL G SPOT (for amab people)
    └─This ^ fr!!! But i just didn’t know if being on hrt makes if feel any better? Or if it’s just the same lol


What did I just look at, I’m so confused


What the fuck?


r/transitiongoals ngl. Not what she’s doing but what she looks like


Hahahahahh


Um…….. what am I looking at?🥴
  └─Um... "art" 🤣   yeah, I'm gonna go with that.


oh


cursed


Hm.


Quick nobody reply


Great idea


That's... nice for them


I'm really not tho..


This is funny and all but no object without a flared base should ever go in your ass.


I’d recommend doing this with an old phone you don’t want to get pinkeye because you shoved your regular everyday phone in your ass. 
   Also don’t shove phones up your ass. If it has no flair, it don’t go there.


I'm not valid 😭


Wish i was that thick


TIHI
   It's so chaser-y it feels like it goes all the way towards TERFy


Although I get the humor... This is still nsfw on an all age reddit group.I'm an adult, but even I'm thinking there should be an adult/nsfw\_egg separate from the main egg\_irl for these types of memes.
   Conserning the post itself, kind of why I really don't say shit about my dysphoria too often. This is using dysphoria/doubt/self resentment as a way to satisfy hornyness. Like... Come on. There are many of us who are actually hurting here. This joke is just getting old.
