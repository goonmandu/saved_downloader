The double whammy has gotten me a few times too. I also am a big fan of picking someone up, and them immediately getting crushed by a rock that came in last second.


Now that’s a clap


Oof, the double tap


sometimes shit just happens


Oo the rage :) been there - not fun under a rock when down.. unlucky that :(


That happens a lot :D


I lol'd so hard


I have only really tanked dungeons. Is BB/IG a good dps combo?
  └─I'd say it's better for PvP then PvE but it's new to me since I've played healer since launch, this is my fresh start character and I'd thought I'd try something different.
