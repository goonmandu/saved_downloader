  └─Incest is a worryingly popular fetish.
    └─I theorize that incest is becoming increasingly popular due to an increase in the frequency of shut-ins and hikkikomori in both Japan and the West. Combined with proximity to family members that usually results in such cases and I think somewhere down the line, things get twisted in their minds that their sisters or whatever are the only action they might be able to get so it fuels fantasies. The COVID lockdowns probably didn't do anything to help with that and might've made it more popular.
       Of course, I could just be totally stupid and the real reason is because some people are just fucking weird like that.
      └─incest lore
      └─Jesse what the fuck are you talking about
        └─Uh mostly the truth, yeah
          └─I don’t understand a word you’re saying Jesse
      └─Or y’know, *it’s fiction and people are aware that fiction does not equal reality and so they can fetishize anything they want without actually wanting to do it irl*. Well at least some people are.
