Thinking of starting Genshin for the first time tomorrow, A little nervous though lol I want Ganyu so bad along with Hu\_tao
  â””â”€good luck op
     ganyu+hu tao deals more than enough damage to cheese 90% of the overworld content
    â””â”€Thanks I saw/heard Ganyu's banner ends on the 27th, if I start tomorrow would I have enough time to get her before her banner ends?, sorry just wanted to ask,
      â””â”€it's all down to luck and how much you want to spend
         my friend started playing genshin just 3 days before the banner ends, and managed to get ganyu within the first 10 pulls. so it's not impossible
         though, to 100% get ganyu, you need about 180 pulls, which is a lot
         you can start playing now, throw everything you can at her, and if you dont get her, save your primo for hu tao, and try to get ganyu on her next rerun
         also, the pity carries over between banners. so if you get spooked by random 5 star on this banner, your next 5 star WILL be the featured character, even if the banner has changed
        â””â”€Awesome thank you, plan on watching some more vids about it before playing just to prepare,
          â””â”€Best of luck OP
            â””â”€Thanks,
      â””â”€id say depends on how much you play when you just start there is definetly enough content for you to get enough primos to get to pity twice to guarantee her
