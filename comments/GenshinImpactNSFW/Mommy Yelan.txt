PNC hit like 9/11 so let's analyze this, Aether is either crying or sweating idk which but for the narrative let's say crying. Why would he be crying in this situation unless he is being forced to do this against his will. Yelan is also either sweating or crying by the same wetness on her face let's say she's just sweating because she is being aroused also evidenced by the fact that there is a sweat drop on her breasts. So what led up to this? Well my belief is, because of the fact that the original post on Twitter says that it's breakfast time and she is producing milk, she is pregnant or has an infant child or 2. so, what if Aether got drunk at a party and accidentally got Yelan pregnant while he was still in a relationship, and Yelan is using this as blackmail to get him to do whatever she wants him to do. This explains why Yelan has a look of accomplishment, while Aether looks distressed and is crying. Could it be ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
