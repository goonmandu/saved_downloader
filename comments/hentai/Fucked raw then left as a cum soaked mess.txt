Kinda funny how all the people in the comments are complaining but this post is the first in hot with 3.5k upvotes lol
   This comment section is even worse than under the average megumin post
   Edit: holy jesus it now has 4.3k just 15 minutes later
   Goes to show how many people truly care lmao
  └─Very true, I also don’t understand the need for hate. If you don’t like it, don’t look at it. It’s pretty simple
    └─We are on a social media site. If you dont like something it has no right to exist. Scrolling past it would be to easy.
       You might argue its against reddits tos. Which in this case might honestly be true. Still doesnt warrent this outcry instead of just reporting it. (According to the tos the "acctual age" doesnt matter btw just how the character looks)
       Funny enough reddit didnt even care about this until all the big investors and advertisers came.
       Meanwhile we have giga chad pixiv that lets u upload whatever you want as long as its 100% fiction.
      └─Yeah that is the unfortunate truth of social media and as you said, at least Pixiv still exists where you have a lot more freedom from these “hating howlers”
        └─Sometimes there are english hate comments under really popular loli posts on pixiv....which is funny because that means the person either searched the tag or the algorithem recommended it to them. And the algorithem is pretty good.
           This speaks for itself basically.
           And on pixiv you can delete comments under your post. I never had to do that. The japanese are very polite. Someone even asked me in DM if he can use an artwork of mine for a compilation on youtube. HE ASKED instead of just taking it. I couldnt believe it. DeepL was very helpdul as my jp is pretty trash. He apperently even linked my art in the video because i saw traffic from youtube in my analytics. I didnt even ask him to do that
    └─People who hate it secretly like it
      └─That very well might be the truth for most of em
  └─If you've seen comment section of average r/hentai post once then you've seen them all. Same can be said about average r/hentai post with petite girls.


Is there a sub like this? Where the girl just get left there after sex?
  └─Why u guys booing me?  We dont kink shame here tf
    └─From my experience, people very much definitely always kink shame here. Reddit is actually the worst site I’ve ever seen for kink shaming due to the average redditor being egotistical as shit.
      └─Average redditor: "ew that's disgusting!" *upvote*
        └─Then kink shame the others smh
  └─Closest I have found is r/helplesshentai
    └─Oddly specific
    └─…
    └─What the fuck


Istg if someone says she is a 4000yo dragon queen
  └─[removed]
    └─Has anyone acctualy ever used this? Im pretty sure its just a meme at this point.
       Most artists dont make excuses they simply dont care
    └─At that point, you're just self-projecting. There are women that look really young for their age, like Gura. She's in her 20s, but she has plenty of stories of people treating her like a child.
  └─Idk if this is a joke cause I'm that dense, but people don't actually say that to everything loli related lol


Jail…immediately


She looks like that girl from Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It, I can’t remember her name tho.
  └─Ena Ibarada
    └─Yea she’s the one thanks
      └─Np


I’m laying in my freshly made bed, I don’t think I’m ever going to make my bed as good as I have tonight.


What is her age
  └─clearly it’s her 18th birthday party
  └─Everyone is 18 in porn
  └─[removed]
    └─Reddit fucking moment
    └─And then you get downvoted for giving the truth. What a shame
      └─[deleted]
        └─You’re a hypocrite.
  └─14


Must…cuddle…
