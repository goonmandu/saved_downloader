I have seen the top half of the image before but never the bottom one. So this is neat.
  └─Yeah, it's pretty great!
  └─True.


Yoooo there's a sequel of the image now.
   Love it.
  └─There is and it's really nice! And I've gotta say, neither of them are wrong.


The second image is from a different artist: blackmore23
   Best to credit them too
  └─Oh, I wasn't aware. Looking at the artstyles again, that makes sense. Thanks for letting me know!
    └─Ofc. I only know this because I had the two images saved to my... "research" folder
      └─I can't find a profile for blackmore23 online, but I've updated my comment with the artists and source.
  └─That's why I've always seen only the top image...
  └─They look so similar!


Oh heck, didn't realize there was a part 2
  └─Apparently, some different artist made it.


This is so gay in a lesbian way

Be thankful, Yang. With Ruby’s super speed she could have done so much more.
  └─That's a good point.
    └─No, she would have USED a good point…


Nice!
  └─Agreed!


Bro, this is too hot and cute at the same time.


unexpectedly wholesome. Didn't know there's a sequel to the top part


I look average when I’m fully clothed


The long awaited 2nd panel has arrived
  └─It has indeed.


Source?


I love that pic.


Who was the artist for the 1st image?
  └─It's [NDGD](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/5624416).
    └─Cool thanks
      └─No problem!


I too, look extraordinarily fashionable when naked


I'd fuck both of em.

Sweat home Alabama

Well...


I was looking at this, then reading the comments, and then I realized… isn’t… isn’t ruby a minor?
  └─"Is she a minor?"-says every minor ever.
