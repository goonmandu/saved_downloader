  └─Thanks for the sauce


She’s enjoying getting poked down there (as painful as it is irl)
  └─Painful?
    └─Yes, for women, hitting the cervix is the closest thing to getting kicked in the balls.

        └─“Is my girlfriend a weirdo 🤥?”
        └─Some women enjoy it. Takes time to work up to it and best to ease into it, but it can be good.


Never understood the whole dick punching the cervix thing. Vast majority of women don’t like it. It’s painful.

do people really jack off to this type of animation
  └─Her abdomen looks like it's expanding, like some enormous inhuman object is just- Ugh
    └─Maybe it's just the pov, she's probably going back and forth instead of up and down
      └─But even then, the anatomy of it doesn't make sense. If you move closer to the camera like that, your body would naturally shift and the perspective would change to fit it. Also the style of animation is inherently off in my opinion, the body just doesn't look right
        └─Yeah that makes sense, the way her abdomen is moving but her torso isn't moving with it. And of course the anatomy is off, it's hentai, of course boobs wouldn't be that big if you weren't tubby. I also see what you mean by expanding, her lower half kinda just stretches out
