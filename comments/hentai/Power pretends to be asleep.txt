        └─[deleted]
          └─He does this in like episode 4 or 5 of the anime
  └─i’m pretty sure only one squeeze was with breast pads but the other two aren’t


She dont have to pretend anymore in the upcoming episode
  └─I feel bad for you
    └─Should we tell him?
      └─Guys let my mans at least jerk off without spoilers


Guess she got a nat 20 on that deception roll
  └─[deleted]
    └─Dennis XD
      └─If Chainsaw Man was localized by 4Kids
  └─I thought I was in r/Dndmemes for a sec


“i’m not awake” well, that convinced him lol


Huh, well, apparently she did bathe after all


Denji would never.


Lol their comparability for each other’s humor is too good


So that's gonna happen in episode 5


This is the real reason I’ve been waiting for CSM to get an anime


Wow love how fast they can make such a good animation of a new show like this

  └─Who’s the artist?
  └─Don't get why people saying new? Like this anime just came out there like on episode 4. There is a Manga of it that's already been out but this is the first anime of it.


That's necrophilia, and power has pads
  └─i think you mean somnophilia
    └─Nah, definitely necrophilia as a fiend in CSM is a corpse posessed by devils
      └─yeah but she’s still “alive” so it wouldn’t be necrophillia
        └─She's not alive.


Sauce?
  └─it's at the end of the gif
    └─Did a few searches for consomekitchen, consome kitchen patreon, and consome kitchen twitter and pulled nothing up, could I ask for a link?
      └─consome kitchen pixiv gives their pixiv and a few down is their twitter
  └─https://twitter.com/consome2021/status/1587717748095795200?s=20&amp;t=IpRWbb2RkxOVmzeAOo3KQg


Who’s gonna tell them.. (the anime watchers)


What's this anime?
  └─Chainsaw Man. The anime just recently came out.
  └─Definitely check the show out if you’re thirsty, it’s got stuff like this: https://i.imgur.com/qOGR9F8.jpg 
     But also horribly gross demons, so ya get what you get.
    └─What do you mean by horribly gross? I'm scared to search myself
      └─Not too bad I guess. If you are iver 13 then it’s almost nothing
      └─I’m a baby, just kinda scary to most probably lol.
      └─Extreme gore


Someone has read the manga. Dennis  It's very contentual and she's known to wear patting


Kono powa


this isn’t real, her boobs are fake in the anime/manga &gt;:0
  └─This isn't the anime/manga, it's an alternative timeline where she got possessed by the "Slightly bigger than regular size breasts" devil!
  └─What chapter i dont remember that
    └─Bruh


Source?
  └─https://twitter.com/consome2021
  └─end of gif


I know this is a lot to ask from people who watch hentai, but can we have less rape on the sub please
  └─It's consensual. Denji is a gentleman who always asks for permission.
     Plus, Power is obviously pretending to be asleep.
    └─Yeah she literally says "I'm not awake" lol, who actually believes she's sleeping
      └─Ok, in this guy's defense, denji is a total idiot
        └─I have yet to finish episode 1 but seeing that he quote unquote swallowed/ate (idk) a cigar for 100 yen, i agree
          └─Well, he was at least smart enough not to actually swallow it, but damn he's still dumb enough to even put a LIT cigarette in his mouth, but I guess he did need the money, so I don't blame him for that one.


Whats the sauce?

I hate when they change strong women characters to little cute, small and helpless pussy to fuck. If she wanted she definitely would fuck the life of him and kill him.
