This anime and manga was no where on my radar but I watched the first Ep and I loved it. Sega for liiiife.
  └─Wait, it's not Zelda?
    └─Nope. Uncle from Another World. On Netflix in US and being Fansubbed by Subsplease.
      └─I was gonna say the two look very similar
        └─Aye I could definitely see it :-p I would watch or read a manga for Zelda with that art style for sure. It’s quite pretty.


Hey i know this anime cause of a sparkmotes like youtube channel. She is very cute!


Definitely something Ojisan will do while having absolutely no malicious intentions
  └─IIRC I think he did saw her naked to check if she has bruises and he’s TOTALLY pure.
