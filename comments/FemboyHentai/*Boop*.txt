   Bet he plays with them a lot if they're that sensitive :3
  └─Is that how it works? The more you play the more sensitive it gets? Sorry if that sound like a dumb question.

       Can speak from experience to say that pinching and teasing em for a few weeks definitely makes them more sensitive\~
