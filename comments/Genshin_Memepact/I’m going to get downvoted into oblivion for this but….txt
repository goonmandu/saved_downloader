Man, people do be milking this topic. Holy heavens.
  └─It's just the current trending issues. Like any other drama on this sub. Making a big deal out of an obscure interview, rushing an optional content and complaining it's too long and now this... Tis the cost of a giant community...
    └─people complained about too long / too much content in a "game expansion"? o_O geez
      └─People rush content as soon as it drops than complains theirs no content. They rush events day 1 if they can be and complain there's no content. They complain when events aren't want they want. When rewards aren't what they want.
         There's a very large vocal part of this community that basically just loves to complain to hear their own voice.
        └─Id say it's the vocal minority and it's a problem that got better since the early days
        └─I had 500+ hours in the first 3 months and a half when the game released. I was addicted lol. Now I have Chasm and Enkanomiya mostly unexplored (though I got the way points) and more than 20+ quests in the journal, not including the hidden ones or the ones not popped up yet, 3 or 4 character quests and all the hangouts. Still have to do the Neko one on Seirai. It honestly feels crazy good to know that I have something to return to every time I open the game. Also... Waiting for Scaramouche. Because I want to play with him. Or I will just make a habit to explore everything once the region is fully released (with side region like Chasm, Enkanomiya) as Inazuma.
  └─gotta grind them internet points
    └─If I wanted the internet points all I would have to do is say “Twitter bad, Twitter dumb” and put it on a funny little template. That usually does the job when it comes to this sub
      └─wasn't talking about you or this post in specific, it's just every drama gets milked to the point of annoyance
        └─I agree. The sheer amount of posts is what made me post my own, just because it felt like I was seeing the same exact thing in different formats
  └─Please let’s just return to the wholesome Collei memes.
    └─My guy, Go to the collie redit


Why suddenly so many Aether Harem topics tho. Has something happened?
  └─Nilou's release caused a higher amount of "obsessed jealous waifus fighting each other for traveler's affection" memes than usual, and when a type of content begins to oversaturate like that, a group of people, who didn't like that content in the first place, but would previously mostly ignore it, starts voicing their dissatisfaction.
     Then the resulting conflict sparks a "discussion" and everybody wanting to throw in their own opinion, leading to further posting.
     It's mostly about Aether because those memes usually feature him as the protag.
    └─I just ship him with myself. Every other 2D Girl can go prick themselves.
      └─Absolute based chad.
      └─The Aether Main we need but don't deserve.
        └─I am an Aether main by heart. But in my main account I play as Lumine cuz I can’t see him going into ‘hangouts’ with chicks, while others without hangouts don’t get a funny idea when they invite him to festivals. 
           Altho I do have an account with Aether where I main him and just him and haven’t really pulled any character.
          └─That's so inspiring dude, I will definitely make an account dedicated to Aether as well. As a Lumine main, I also kept pulling for the husbandos as peace offerings for our Abyss Prince Aether lol
      └─What a based individual. Someone finally gets it Aether is the best boy!
      └─Lmfao
      └─Well...the game is technically 3D so...
        └─No not exactly its not a 3d game. I mean I know why you’re calling it 3D and even I had this misconception but its actually not
      └─RAW
        └─ARE YOU INSINUATING ME AND AETHER DO IT RAW!?!?
           Because if you do I don’t mind
      └─A-ayaka? How did you got out of the game??
        └─I feel like whatever I have said has been invalidated by this comment XD
    └─Not to meme, but this is literally a 'we live in a society' kind of progression.
  └─*Why suddenly so*
     *Many Aether Harem topics*
     *Tho. Has something happened?*

  └─Too immersed in gacha hell?
    └─Ayo?
  └─I noticed 
     Which is kinda funny because the mischacterization in fate is the game fault


I mean it’s not really shippers who make the yandere memes but just memers. Also Lumine perv stuff is done by pervs. I mean one of those pervy lumine artists draws incest and bestiality. When it comes to actual shippers the arts and comics are actually really sweet stuff.
  └─I’m aware, which is why I’m taking about the meme subreddit in particular. This shit gets posted over and over and I find it annoying. This post is me explaining why I think the Aether harem posts on this sub are much worse than the Lumine ones
    └─&gt;This post is me explaining why I think the Aether harem posts on this sub are much worse than the Lumine ones
       if we're on that side then I'll argue that turning precious lumine into a deranged pervert is an equal offence to the aether harem posts
      └─Gudako does it better tbh
      └─Counterpoint-The Lumine change only happens to her, compared to the multiple characters that appear within these harem posts. Additionally, Aether and Lumine are inherently more moldable characters. While they do have personalities, their nature as a mostly silent protagonist relegate it to voice lines. I’d argue that having these strong albeit inaccurate personalities is preferable to if they are portrayed as stoic. Also, deranged is a strong word.
        └─As I mentioned in another comment, in Lumine's harem, people make everyone her sex toy. I don't think Ei likes Lumine to use her like a sheath nor I think Nilou likes Lumine coming out of nowhere, pulling her skirt a little and licking her navels
          └─Yes this "artists" see Lumine as a perverted creep and it ruins her entire character for me.
            └─same goes for yandere ayaka and the others
               people take memes way too seriously
            └─You could just cut down on the Genshin hentai if it's ruining your immersion
              └─Bro fym hentai, softcore nsfw comics or drawings that depict Lumine as a pervert show up pretty often in subs like these
    └─I don't get why you say Aether's harem is worse than Lumine both are practically the same, if you saying the girls in Aether harem get reduced to cum dumps, and it's considered a mischaracterization, don't the girls in Lumine's harem get reduced to submissive fuck toys too? Because there is no way Ei would let Lumine use her chest as sword or dildo sheathe.
    └─So... Lumine is drawn as a pervert creep (Put Aether in half of those and the artist would get shit on) but Aether is worse because the girls do the exact same shit Lumine does ?
       &amp;#x200B;
       lmao obviously Aether can't get away with what Lumine does so they have to put the sexual ~~aggressivity~~ aggressiveness on the girl. Both are the exact same.
    └─On that we can agree as I really do hate the yandere memes I know they are jokes but when that is just about the only joke that has been repeated for so long then it gets tiring and frankly hate the image it gives people who enjoy the ships.
    └─There is no real issue. People only choose these characteristics because it's socially acceptable and comedic. Get over it. If you want more variety that's also funny, dish it out yourself. And I'm not saying draw it yourself. I'm just saying, put some ideas out there for people to draw. What's the point of complaining if you don't present a solution?
       Maybe your solution would be better, maybe it'll fail and get stomped on, but at least you try. Better than just complaining.
      └─I like how everytime someone make a point they get downvote
        └─Just means they ain't ready to handle the truth. I tried and it failed, but seeing your comment makes it worth it. Thanks.
          └─Don't worry I'm not to stress for anything my fucking life is the center of my attention right now
            └─You and me and everyone else haha. Hope the best for you. I know you're doing the best you can.
              └─Thanks man
  └─I get downvoted every time I pointed that out because I guess some triggered folks automatically assume that anyone telling them that a thing isn't that serious and people are just joking is trying to gaslight them or something.


I've seen the exact opposite for both twins too, and A LOT of wholesome content.
  └─You must have been in some sort of heaven all we got is slandering and cancel culture.


harem drama is dumb, aroace traveler lets gooo 🔥
  └─Subscribed. Only goal is to find sibling and nothing will detract from that mission
    └─Unless it is five minutes adventure to nearby town with local ranger.
    └─Sigma (fe)male grindset
  └─This has always been how I saw it. The traveler is a 'star-being'. There's no point in striking a romance with any mortal when the traveler will outlive said mortal anyways. And if your life is that long sex probably becomes an extremely small blip of meaningless pleasure in comparison. That's why the traveler cares only about their twin. Only the twin will live long enough to be by their side.
     So aromantic + asexual traveler has always been how I see it
    └─Well there’s solutions for that A. Date other imortals like Ei, Xiao, venti or Ganyu. Or celestia has the power to make vision holders immortal as they are set up to be the final boss the traveler can take it over and use that system to make their partner an immortal as well.
      └─Aight second part
         World hoppers
         Travelers gonna travel what do
        └─Ask Zhongli to do his xianxia magic and shove the entirely of Teyvat into a pocket dimension inside the Teapot. Then just bring it with them during travel. If Phanes can contain Teyvat in their eggshell then it’s theoretically possible for xianren to do the same too.
      └─Theyre not immortal though. They just have very long life spans but they will definetely die one day.
        └─So far we have not seen any immortal die of age the only worry is erosion. Zhongli is over 5000 and still feeling fine.
  └─Based
  └─THIS IS THE BEST WAY!
  └─The harem is actually Paimon's.
  └─LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO AROACE REP!!!
    └─bruh think about it, this entire game is aroace rep! Genshin is the most Aro/Ace-friendly game I've ever played. Literally no playable character is in a confirmed romantic relationship, and nor is attracted to anyone! And also there are beautiful and caring friendships in the game, no amatonormativity! You're free to headcanon  ANYONE as AroAce and IT WILL STILL MAKE COMPLETE SENSE!!!
  └─holy crap YES!!
  └─based non romance traveler 🔥🔥🔥
  └─Kinda defeated by them flirting with characters like jean, kokomi, and that one NPC girl.
    └─aroace ppl can flirt tho?
      └─If someone doesn’t experience romantic attraction then how do they flirt still ?


   Just curious on your reasoning, you say Aether's is worse since characters are getting reduced to simps while Lumine's is just her being pervert. I mean one could say in Lumine's case, she is being reduced to a sex hungry pervert while other characters are being reduced to sex objects. Don't get me wrong, I understand your reason to dislike Aether's harem by itself, but I don't understand how Lumine's is any better.
  └─This is also very bias of the OP for only putting Lumine as the one being mischaracterized in her harem memes but clearly the girls also get reduced to submissive fuck toys in this said memes, I wouldn't say it's not the same as Aether some times it works like that, I am just adressing the fact that they put more things for mischaracterizations under Aether, and didn't point out the ones in Lumine which pretty bias in my opinion.
  └─I guess it's because in one case, only Lumine is mischaracterized as a perv, but it's still a personnality trait, while in Aether's harem, it's multiple women who have their personnality erased to suit the simp type.
     Also we saw more harem stuff with Aether than Lumine, both are bad, but people will be upset at what they see most.


Pretty much the same bias where if a man sleeps with multiple women he’s an alpha, but if a woman does the same thing with men she’s a wh**e.
  └─I don't think most people have that attitude though. If anything Aether gets a lot more hate than Lumine on here cos there's more Aether harem memes than Lumine ones.


Hot take: who the fuck cares about any of this shit touch grass
  └─Genshin community apparently
  └─Based Luigi. When is this shit gonna end?
  └─I do, I love debate clubs
     But I only watch them, I don't join.

*Meanwhile me hugging my Venti body pillow:* “da fuk they doin ova der”
  └─Venti best cause he works both ways ;)


😐😐😐
   Just another karma farm post.


So what I'm seeing here is that Aether x Lumine is the true solution to these "problems"
  └─Incest is wincest


Does it really matter? It's not like that in game so who gives two shits?


What I see is that the women, whether they own the harem or are part of it, are the ones being mischaracterized as perverts to fulfill straight harem or lesbian harem fantasies.


I'mma just ship them with whoever I want to and not engage in the silly wars lol


As someone is indifferent to both harem sides of the spectrum I can see the difference in why it might trigger some people
   With Lumine she is also among the "Self insert conversation" so her character is a lot more flexible in terms of personality
   But when it comes to Aether harem you are changing characters with established personalities and making them fall for the "blank template".
   However there are many comics in this fandom that completely change characters or have them interact with characters they dont know especially when it comes to shipping. So it kind of is a double standard when it comes to some of the complaints, like if its fine to love a comic about "x character and x character" even if they dont know each other or completely changing their personalities, then getting annoyed at a character being memed as a yandere for Aether harem is just a weird kind of double standard
   I dont think the twins are self insert or a blank template but I can definitely see why the latter pisses people off more even if I think getting pissed off about it is going overboard
  └─I’m fine with personality changes so long as they don’t strip away character for the sake of the ship being more straightforward.
     So for example, a Beigguang comic or fanfiction. If all that goes through their heads is just love for each other, it’s a major disservice to any nuance within the two’s relationship. They can get along well at times but they still step on each other’s feet. If you’re going to ship them, show that.
     In the typical Yandere Ayaka posts, they show her being jealous and angry. But Ayaka is a very kind person, and if anything she would be sad. I think I actually saw some art of that recently. She saw Nilou and Aether walking and instead of going dead-eyed she just looked sad. There, that’s a way to still have the joke of Ayaka being jealous but keeping it potentially within character.
    └─I feel you
       I literally only ship Aether with Shenhe because in canon there is a lot going for it
       Whenever I see Shenhe and Yelan its either: changing Shenhes character, or replacing Aether with Yelan and making it look like Yelan is the one Shenhe feels that way about. Its gotten to the the point people who play genshin but dont have either genuinely think they feel that way about it
       Its the same thing with the memes you are talking about, I like them in moderation but when they get spammed as quickly and as frequently as masochist Nilou or Yandere Ayaka did I do get tired of it.
       But im not going to go on a post about said meme or ship and say its trash, Its easy to let people enjoy it if they want to
      └─Shen he x Aether is a goat tier ship sadly so less is posted about it. 
         And Ye Lan and Shen he even haven't met if I remember. They just shipped them because they look like Xingqiu and Chongyun.
        └─If they ever met:
           Yelan: Who the fuck are you?  
           Shenhe: I have no idea....


Also, I’d like to clarify that I don’t hate Aether ships or harem stuff. Done right, I really enjoy it and wish there was more. I really like u/Final-Solid7789 ’s art for example, as it lets the characters be interested in the traveler without reducing them to a trope or some sort of object
  └─I'm too old for this shit and I do enjoy SoL things like what Kuro did. I don't despise any kind of relationships because, well, they're fictional.
     But most of the time what we see has its own audiences and definitely not what we interested in.
    └─This. You really can't have everything your way in the anime industry especially if we're talking about fan creations. 
       Anyone who has been exposed to this industry for a long time knows that you'll always see things you won't like at least once, and it takes a lot of searching around for the right artist that resonates with your taste. 
       It's either we do our best to find the right artist/become the artist, or learn to love what you see. Same logic applies when you're looking for an anime to watch.


don't know and don't care. still going to ship Lumine and Thoma just because

Both cringe for diffrent reasons i don't like harmes


The actual reason Aether’s harem stuff if worse is simply because there’s more of it and that gives more opportunity for it to be bad. This kind of stuff is typically really well drawn and beautiful art that is conceptually awful for various reasons. 
   Sometimes you get good stuff on either side, and it’s not inherently evil, but the true fact of the matter is that a man with a harem is a tired trope that often leads to lazy and uninteresting scenarios, while a woman with a harem is fresh enough that the creator often gets creative and interesting with the situations. Not always, mind you, but you see less of it and what you see is sometimes better than the other side. 
   Honestly, this is more of a Genshin issue imho. In the Honkai fanbase I’ve rarely seen any terrible Captainverse fanfic or art because they rarely need to commit character assassination to make it, it seems like they know and care about the all characters they represent, and the Captain is more of a self-insert which makes them less likely to make him a psychopath, as they *are* him in a sense. I feel like the main problem with *all* Genshin harem and shipping culture is that the Genshin fanbase as a whole has little to no media literacy or understanding of the characters they represent, and often simply don’t or haven’t had a chance to read and play the character stories and hangout events, so they frankly don’t know who tf any of these people are and simply go off of whatever the public thinks or go off of the one to two lines of lore that they know. 
   At the end of the day, tl:dr this whole topic is annoying because people are defending art they like the look of or fantasies they enjoy without recognizing that you can like it and it can also have actual issues that need addressing, and that doesn’t mean you have to stop liking it or be a bad person.


I’m going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but…
   Who tf cares about mischaracterization they’re just memes and this is a meme sub
  └─I find it hilarious we got Qiqi who wants to drink Ganyu’s breast milk, Childe being Zhongli’s wallet,Hu Tao wanting to bury every person to make more profit, Ei is a neet gamer and likes to cry about every single thing is ignored for being ‘mischaracterising a character’ when Aether’s harem memes are hated on more as such.


Im pretty sure even lumine partner also change in their personality,xiao doujin for example naw bruh he really let her do whatever she want? Where is xiao edgy personality,he would just stay back and observe the situation,i do know he care about traveler but that doesn't mean he can let mc do whatever they want
  └─My guy I think you might misunderstand Xiao. He’s less feral cat and more kicked puppy, don’t let the Burst voice lines fool you
    └─It not about burst voice line,it all his voice line


I still dont get why people are fighting over this, it's not like the mischaracterization of the sibling will affect the actual in-game story in any way?
  └─Haven't we learned from the DBZ abridged affect where people took the parody portrayal of the characters as canon


Lewdmine is real and Yandere waifus fighting over Aether. I see no problem as this both as comic relief.


i only have an issue when people say they're underaged☠️


Aren't double standards great like op's post for example


Do we not realize this is a general issue with fetishizing the idea of "a girl is horny"? It's the same old objectification of women we should be well aware of by now.
  └─I'd disagree. For last several centuries at least, woman were expected to be passive and innocent virgins, while men were expected to be always the active side and all time horny and only thinking of sex.
     If it became normalised to portray both sides as being horny it would mean we're getting closer to gender equality.
    └─Tbh there's nuance in the way it's depicted. Is the horny man being depicted as an alpha chad "conquering" the girls or is he depicted as a dangerous, undesirable deviant? Is the horny woman being depicted as someone with complete control and power over her own sex life, or is she being portrayed as an easy lay and an object of desire whose value lies in her desperation to fuck the male subject?
       I think that difference might be the crux here for some people, it's not really a binary "men are shown as horny, women are shown as not horny," we also have to factor in other dimensions as well.
  └─Ehh, what? I genuinely don't understand, you are saying depicting women as horny is sexist? Is this some kind of new Twitter meta now?
    └─No.
       I love healthy portrayal of girls with high libidos that show women are humans who like sex too instead of the pure and innocent, infantilizing bullshit. 
       The problem is where people use women with high libido to reduce them to sex objects who constantly want this guy's dick and it's all they're here for. Which Aether harem shit does.
      └─So just making sure, you would say the exact same to Lumine harems and gay harems right? Cuz at the end of the day, they’re all objectifying everyone around the central person in your view?
  └─Wow so you’re thinking that BTS fangirls would have at least a merch or two of their favorite boy bands and also Genshin Impact gamer girls who actively simp for Kaeya,Al-Haitham,Ayato because they’re NOT horny? I have a feeling you are the one who’s objectifying women when you think women shouldn’t be allowed to have a single libido and should just exist as substitutes of aroaces when knowing being horny once in a while is completely fine. The only thing you need to watch out for is coomers and porn addicts and if you were also to portray all men as such,then that’s a sexist problem for you.


They're both just jokes, memes. If you find one or neither unfunny just move on. The mischaracterization will never amount to anything substantial so just relax and have a laugh.
  └─If only people think like this but their natural instinct tells them to go mald about it.
    └─The mischaracterization they think we're themselves


Doesn’t Aether harem stuff have that AND Aether being a pervert?
   I’ve yet to seen Lumine harem stuff where the guys or gals get reduced to yanderes besides the obvious Ayaka one
  └─Only a select few of Aether is being portrayed like that but mostly is just wholesome and harmless ship arts between him. u/Final_Solid7789 and also AepuruArts does the best kind of harem Aether arts as he still allows the girls to delve with their canon personalities without being portrayed as a blank slate for his love. The Yandere Ayaka meme started around her last rerun and before that she wasn’t even that popular in the ships arts. 
     With Lumine you can see mostly she’s the ‘chaotic lesbian sibling’ and it’s been an ongoing thing for so long. Princess Hinghoi likes to make Lumine sexually harassing all the female characters and also there’re fanmade anime from the CN community that likes to portray her that way. That’s why I mostly avoided it cuz I feel it’s making me lose my braincells and there’s no point on getting vexed about it.


So both are mischaracterisations, neither is worse than the other, cause both don't show the actual personality of the characters. But for some reason, people seem to think the first thing is something acceptable, and the 2nd thing is something that deserves hate, insults and death threats. That is the whole reason why this whole drama started
  └─They hated because He told them the truth.
  └─Op is bias asf and thinks aether harem comics are shit compared to lumine, even the both are just the same. His others comments prove his narrow mindedness
    └─Ah i see, that's kind of sad...
       I myself don't really like the Lumine ones, but i can recognize that both have the same mischaracterisations and should be treated the same
      └─Lumine fans think she is superior, ig they should just grow up. They are literally the same


both. both is bad.


Just realized Lumine mischaracterization would only be a problem if most ppl didn’t think of traveller as blank slates.


I think it's more about the fandom, the female and male side of it change how lumine and aether are perceived. But that's only my opinion


Well... Lumine stuff comes from Gudako, most likely
   Now, the yandere part came from ayaya's banner being eternal.


You guys arguing I'm here for sauce


Don't mind me I'm just enjoying Aether x Lumine myself 😌


but both make everybody else horny


Sorry op but this is wrong in fact everyone is.
   Aether and lumine are both two 3D-Models that are placed in an engine and paired with code and animations to convey a message. Their characteristics and "being" is defined solely by lines of code and thought up stories.
   Everything else which isn't in the game is fantasy and conjured up by all your brains.


Ayo gonna need a source on those lumine pics


I find it funny to see aether running away from his waifus when they go full on yandere mode. I find it funny to see lumine perving over men and playing w them too. I main both on different accounts and I honestly don't see a problem as they're just memes, it's for the humor and I don't see why is everyone getting so worked up over it


Ngl I'm with Lumine in this 😌


I only like the Lumine stuff because I find it mildly funny and can kinda relate, I can't relate to the aether stuff because I get no bitches


My opinion on the sexualities/relationships of the characters:
   Calm down son, it’s just a drawing


Gimnaeng Aether: AEEUUUGGGGHHHHH!
   Lumine: feeling hot when daddies approach her


Pervert Lumine is funny.


Well what can I say? I do love me some gremlin sex offender Lumine and Yandere magnet/victim Aether


So basically you're saying that Aether slots in perfectly to Lumine's harem and vice versa? OTP
  └─Lumither: the horniest couple in genshin.


So people hating him because of what he didnt do? Man these people sucks


Man. Im just here to enjoy these stupid harem memes


Traveller's personality is as bland as it can be. I don't even care about them but I do like other characters and when I see memes where they are reduced to a trope or some kind of tool with no relation to actual story or quests I don't like it. 
   Lumine's one is fine cuz she is the only one that changed in most artworks. as for aether's meme his partner's personality became empty and just functions as a means to satisfy the reader's fetishs.
  └─The Traveler actually *does* have a personality, but it’s just incredibly easy to miss and not as obvious as most other characters. ChillWithAster has a few videos discussing the Traveler’s personality.
  └─Are you sure only lumine is the only one that change,even her partner also change,no way xiao would let lumine do that


I don’t see any issues honestly. Like, this is a gacha game tradition at this point. Started with FGO and the M/F Masters to GBF’s Gran/Djeeta, now GI’s Aether and Lumine. But GI’s community has to escalate everything to drama level problem lmao.
  └─If only did that one guy in the Nilou x Aether post screamed "THis iS criNGe aNd miSChaRactErized and neEdeD tO be STop." Then the other side of the fandom wouldn't had be triggered about Lumine pervy harem which is also itself is a mischaracterization.


Who cares lmao


Sounds like both sides are making jokes and this whole argument is just a bunch of stupid


Yeah yeah yeah we get it, can we go to some original content now? Tired of seeing this worthless diacussion everyday

   Meh.


Eh, if it makes me laugh or it's pretty funny who cares if the fanons are ooc


Jesus, people take this game way too seriously…


Who cares?


Can we please remember that these are fictional characters and that whatever shipping head canons people have are OK?


Keqing has a whole one scene where she's surprised at the though of going to a festival with you (which you can't even play anymore) and all of a sudden she's a Traveller simp
   I love Aether x Keqing but so many people really stretch it into something it's not


So in short, both harems are created by straight male degens for straight male degens, so it's always the females that show extreme sexual interest, because that's what straight male degens want to see. And when these posts take over the entire sub everyone who's not a straight male degen start to express their dissatisfaction with them. But those posts still get a lot of upvotes because a big chunk of this subreddit consists of straight male degens.
   It's the same reason why so many male hentai protags don't even have eyes.


I see no problem with both
  └─You are the first comment on controversials, anything to say?


Is it really mischaracterization? Feels more like people are just putting what they want.
  └─It's funny the op only says the women change but very clearly everyone is for both


From what I’ve noticed some use the same mischaracterizations just in reverse. But these are how it’s most popular. I think this goes along with the fact that a lot of ppl are okay with the depiction of lumine as a sexual predator but not the same for aether. 
   Especially with how the western side of the fandom is, I wouldn’t be surprised if ppl are hesitant or maybe even afraid of the backlash of making such content.
  └─Well they Mald over characters skin colour and shit do you expect the western part of that to do anything?
    └─Well maybe not physically but I wouldn’t be surprised if ppl were experiencing deteriorating mental health.
      └─Yeah I barely heard from cn and jp sides tbh it always the western for some reason do you know why?
        └─Yeah especially the jp side seems pretty chill. No idea why so much drama exists in the west tho.
          └─I heard someone mentioned it due to them having a lot freedom of something something but they though they say crap without consequences


People who get upset about aether harems have the exact same energy as the raging cishets who get upset about gay ships. Just chill. People see things in different ways and people enjoy things in different ways. It's just a video game and no ship is canon.


Am I the only one who likes the Aether and Lumine harems? I find them hilarious.


i dont care. i ship however i like, try it too because being mad about certain things that a lot of ppl from the community ‘like’ isnt gonna change anything


bro what cost to the others those two sides? lumine as perv and aether with the others too, what good content 😈


Can someone tell me what is going on in the left-down lumine pick


True


Why would anyone downvote you its the true tho you dont apport anything to the argument


No no, he's got a point.


Genshin is an anime waifu/husbando collecting game, and much like other games in this genre, memes like this are common and typical, both can be funny and both can be bad. 
   I really don’t see the problem with mischaracterization, they’re all memes and jokes and shouldn’t be taken so seriously, it’s not as if the creators of said memes are actively trying to destroy and bastardize the characters, they’re just overly exaggerating the characters to an extreme to fit the joke. If anyone actually believes any character behaves they do within memes, then that’s on them more than anything.


I don't see the problem in this, I see both of them as win's


That is true for Aether's female harem


Implying that characters aren't mischaracterized in Lumine harem as much as they are in Aether's...
   Double standards, I say.
   I don't appreciate my favorite characters being sexually harassed by a manic female, either, sorry.


This sub was constantly shitting on gay ships and making fun of shippers just months ago and when the aether ships get criticized, y'all cry foul??
   Fucking hypocrites.
  └─Bruh it happens for both gay and straight ships, i know because I'm a fan of neither
  └─Since when this sub even shits on gay ships? Also are ships even allowed on a meme sub in the first place?
