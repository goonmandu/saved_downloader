Me be like
   Mona: Traveler, it's my birthday, come to my house tonight
   Traveler: Can't, Aranara questline still on-going
   Mona: I'm alone...
   Traveler: *\*instantly teleports to Mond with an Aranara on-hand*
   &amp;#x200B;
   The Aranara: Bruh at least drop me off, horny bastard
  â””â”€At least drop off, me, Nara horny
    â””â”€Nara varuna was just as horny as golden nara!
      â””â”€Well if my suspicions about who the golden Nara is are true, it'd make sense huh
        â””â”€That stuff carries over genetically, doesn't it
        â””â”€Yeah, they are absolutely not subtle about who or what Nara Varuna is. Not sure where you're at, but once you're done with the Aranyaka questline &gt;!you can go back to the last seal for a cute painting and a hidden achievement.!&lt;
          â””â”€I'm not near done at all, but thanks. I'll keep that in mind &gt;!along with letting Suspicious McSus go so he can get mauled by rifthounds for another achievement!&lt;
    â””â”€Nara is silly !
    â””â”€Horny narastard.
  â””â”€Aranara be like: damn this nara is horny
    â””â”€Horny nara
  â””â”€Traveler: You don't understand. *Mona's ass waits for nobody*
  â””â”€Aranara will disappear or at least become invisible since Traveler lost his innocence.  
     Also how did amy know about the text message?
    â””â”€In the last panel, it is implied that Mona had Fischl check the letter for grammar mistakes
  â””â”€someone needs to make an art based on this


Good guy Oz with the blunt translation
   Honestly though that birthday message is pretty easily interpreted as such, Hoyo employee must have been sad Mona was overtaken in terms of r18 fanart by Ganyu and Raiden
  â””â”€And the amount of ugly bastard ones that Mona receives. I need more wholesome Mona doujins
    â””â”€Maybe now that Hoyo practically told everyone she isn't actually broke she will get more wholesome ones
       Lewd outfit + can't afford rent = cursed tags
      â””â”€??? That will only encourage them. The better the girl is in terms of status/looks/wealth/intelligence/power, the better she is to degrade for people with certain fetishes.
        â””â”€There is a severe lack of Ningguang doujins and almost all the ones she does have are wholesome
           Either that fetish isn't as popular in this fandom or Ningguang is overlooked in favor of others
           Keqing gets degraded a lot so maybe it all went to her
          â””â”€She has dommy vibes
             The natural deterrent to being used by ugly bastards
             (Why the fuck aren't there any femdom doujins of Yelan though)
            â””â”€The lack of fendom doujins with Yelan is a travesty. That's an untapped potential right there.
              â””â”€Indeed
                 I am writing a femdom fanfic of Yelan though...
                 2 chapters so far
                 Wanna read?
                â””â”€Do you even have to ask?
                  â””â”€https://archiveofourown.org/works/39422847
            â””â”€Well there is one where Yelan *tries* to femdom but the Fatui pull out the reverse uno card and we get dom Mirror maiden for part of it
              â””â”€Dammit 
                 Her trailer gave us a template for it on a silver platter but all the artists can't resist the domination loss ;_;
                 https://archiveofourown.org/works/39422847
                 Sometimes, if you want something done, you do it yourself...
                â””â”€Ayo wtf this kinda good 0_0
                  â””â”€Ayo thanks bro
              â””â”€I hate myself for knowing which one you mean
            â””â”€Nonsense. I've read enough domination loss hentai to know that it really isn't femdom that deters ugly bastard doujins.
               It's probably just due to the girls with teen models being more popular.
            â””â”€Well you see the last guy that drew a yelan doujin was never seen again
        â””â”€I think it's moreso either bratiness or innocence which is most commonly associated with those attributes. Corruption has a hook
      â””â”€&gt;Maybe now that Hoyo practically told everyone she isn't actually broke she will get more wholesome ones
         That never stopped people from making power fantasy hentai.
         If anything, it encourages power fantasy hentai even more.
         The Raiden Shogun being a prime example
      â””â”€Well how do you think she afford those rent then  ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)
      â””â”€&gt;she isn't actually broke
         And what about a most unlikely event where she got a withdrawal and starts craving like one of those blackmail stuff at the resolution plot stage?
         Please don't kill me.
    â””â”€Why canâ€™t we have more wholesome ones where the Traveller financially supports Mona
       Financial stability is my fetish.
      â””â”€Are you me?
    â””â”€As an ugly bastard I relate to those since I can self insert although I wish it wasnâ€™t so brutal and more soft.
      â””â”€Can't be an ugly bastard if you aren't a bastard.
        â””â”€Wholesome
        â””â”€Dude's just ugly
          â””â”€Ugly and proud!
      â””â”€Nah man, you're not ugly bastard, just ugly ðŸ’ª
      â””â”€I guess youâ€™re Pugly Wholesome then?
      â””â”€My name needs no explanation and I too wanted more wholesomeness.
         Especially after the Childe x Ganyu incident.
      â””â”€Iâ€™ve actually seen wholesome doujins where the dude isnâ€™t even the best looking but the girl loves him anyways
      â””â”€So you......so you....blackmail and rape girls ??? You know ugly bastard tag is not about an ugly person having sex with a beautiful girl it's about an ugly person blackmailing and raping a beautiful girl and no ugly person shouldn't self insert as those
        â””â”€Again, it's a fetish. You have urges and they're not nice, so explore it drawn on paper, so that you don't explore it in real life.
    â””â”€Sucrose and the other favonius girls too, there isnt even any sucrose x albedo hentai
  â””â”€**Fischl:** Thou knows the hour when your bond mixes with another, under the glow of the pale moonlight.
     **Oz:** So when you fucking?

Mona and Amy give of sister vibes in this.
  â””â”€&gt; in this.
     The summer event for me 
     want more of them together now


Mona... You can't delete physical letters.
  â””â”€Sure you can! Just burn it up! 
     There! Now it's deleted from existence by being turned into billions of pieces of ash!
    â””â”€A Physical letter that is already sent.
      â””â”€just find it and burn it up!
        â””â”€It was already received.

  â””â”€The Tevyat land speed record was broken earlier this week by what witnesses could only describe as a blonde blur that appeared to be heading from Sumeru to Mondstadt. More at 11
    â””â”€Breaking news! We got a witness telling us he briefly saw this blonde blur and recognized the famous Traveler, he just said "Dat MonAss" before becoming a blur again, more at the evening


This is gold and my personal headcanon now.


My horny ass bee-lined it to Mona's house thinking there's gonna be a button prompt to enter her house :(
  â””â”€I can imagine you were doing a commission and immediately abandoned it once you got the text.
    â””â”€Bonus point if that's that Dragonspine commission where you need to protect a monument far away from any teleport. Fighting the wolf boss also counts. Or trying to grab the electroculus at the top of Raiden's palace.
  â””â”€Lol, I also bee lined to ayaka house on her birthday, finding no one. I immedietly go to yae shrine because she said she wants to watch sakura with traveller tonight or something like that. I dont know how to feel after finding no ayaka there too.
  â””â”€They already built the whole thing for the summer event, just let us in.
  â””â”€My salty ass skimmed through the letter, took the rewards, and ignored it for the rest of the day because *itâ€™s been two years and Monaâ€™s the only standard who hasnâ€™t come home to me yet, so Iâ€™m not coming home to her.*


Man i absolutely love this artstyle
   Also Mona and Fischl just hanging out and Mona calling her Amy-gimme more


She still hasnâ€™t payed taxes
  â””â”€Jean is personally gonna bust her for tax evasion. Also because the Knights who were supposed to be on Tax investigation duty fell asleep and Jean was once again forced to do a job that is not really hers.
    â””â”€[Jean:](https://youtu.be/vyMZuhkpMzc)
  â””â”€&gt; still hasnâ€™t *paid* taxes
     FTFY.
     Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:
      * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*
      * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*
     Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

  â””â”€Are there Income tax and property tax in Mondstaat? I thought their taxes limited to VAT and excise in alcoholic beverage
    â””â”€I wonder how Mondstat government fund its projects if that is the the case unless Mondstat is full of Alcoholics. I guess the lack of aristocracy embezzling funds from the nations treasury helps.
  â””â”€Who represent the IRS in Teyvat?
    â””â”€Jean
      â””â”€I searched up the Knights of Favonius wiki and I found no position responsible for treasury, economical management or funding service.
         Poor Jean having to do all of the non military stuff all the way to odd jobs by herself.
        â””â”€Yeah, with that manpower it is impossible for Knight of Favonius to calculate Income Tax, even Jean calculating VAT for alcoholic beverages makes her collapse


Not as thirsty when Tartaglia sent us that message with the sausage emoji.
  â””â”€Thatâ€™s nothing compared to Kuki Shinobu when she sent us a bunch of Naku Weed and asked us to try some together.
    â””â”€Nah thats not thirsty, thats someone thinking of having a good time
      â””â”€I was not talking about being thirsty. I was talking about how sussy it is. :/
  â””â”€Wait what?
    â””â”€Childe's birthday mail this year had "Lets Meet Up" as the title and the item in the window was a sausage. People started making jokes about childe sending you a sausage pic and asking to meet up.
    â””â”€he sent us the sausage dish iirc lmao
      â””â”€He just sent the ingredient but yea i think it appeared before his specialty dish lmao
  â””â”€Ganyu had a mental breakdown reading that.


It's pointless to follow me on reddit, don't do it. Here's my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/luizhtx/status/1565179034165813249?s=21&amp;t=OiiIPlKEFEwiq7R3hsEt2Q) or follow my Pixiv, idk (link in my profile (contain r18 segs))
  â””â”€Ok fine since I've seen your work across the internet more than twice already and give me a chuckle everytime I guess I'll follow ur twitter
  â””â”€Segs!


I love that Mona and Fischl are friends.
  â””â”€yes I hope we get more of them together in events


Mona, the fact that Fischl gave the OK means that you really ARE that thirsty, because this was the first thing that came to mind on type.


This is especially funny because the EN voice actor also voices a huge kinky perv in the anime Overlord. After watching the show and doing the GAA at the same time I can't unhear it.
  â””â”€You mean Mona's English VA? Who does she play? Lilynette is the only female pervert I can think of.
    â””â”€Shaltear?
      â””â”€Ah, I see. I watch the JP dub since it's available faster, so I didn't know. It totally slipped my mind Shalltear is a pervert.


Yay, seggs!


The bird from the event that was a mona-simp must be jealous af
  â””â”€the bird that was a mona-simp was created from Fischl mind
    â””â”€Yeah but all of the birds represented different people from Mondstadt, so it doesnâ€™t mean that Fischl simps for Mona but instead that someone in Mondstadt simps for Mona.
      â””â”€Yea Ask me for directoins Arnold was probably based on how Albert is to Barbara


I JUST GOT C4 MONA... WTF!!!!
  â””â”€You got a 5 star?
  â””â”€C3 keqing


Even better was getting the commission where you collect rent from her the first time.


 What the fuck is this right to left or left to right
  â””â”€From right to left, like a manga


First Lisa, now Mona, I'm seeing a pattern I [like](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Memepact/comments/v7odyw/why_isnt_this_a_thing_yet/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) a lot
  â””â”€Lisa being Lisa was not surprising even tho it was much lewder than Mona letter
     &gt;!I also like this trend hope they deliver with Ganyu!&lt;


u/luizhtx always come with good stuffs (and horni)


I like that i got the mona commission as soon as the bday message appeared


I read this left to right


Am I missing something? What part of that birthday message sounded thirsty?
   Sure, she mentioned inviting to her house over, but what is it?
  â””â”€you're missing nothing. Its just the Genshin fandom being extremely horny again
  â””â”€At night, tf they doing, playing spot the object?
    â””â”€Watching stars..?
      â””â”€Fair point
  â””â”€alone in her room 
     at night


Oz: "What my Freulein meant is will you have the seggs tonight?"


Hehe, sex
  â””â”€Need Yanfei to explain to Mona about the "seâ€”".


*Applies Hydro to self*


*Insert guy with butterfly meme: Is this a Kaguya reference?


This is me personal headcanon on what happened.


Am i that tone deaf? I don't understand how that could be an invitation in the form everyone think it is
  â””â”€-&gt; Invited to Mona's Room
     -&gt; At Night
     What are they are gonna do, play monopoly?
    â””â”€Connect four
    â””â”€I mean,looking at stars usually require night,so i thought it made sense
      â””â”€Of course thatâ€™s probably what she meant, but innuendos our the internetâ€™s first language.
    â””â”€Like
       Make a birthday party ? Idk, but I also didn't think one second of something sexual. Like... Friendship is a concept that exist yk xD
      â””â”€She is an astrologer that has barely enough money and she wants Tabibito in her room, which is in a once sealed house in Monstadt, which is surrounded by concrete walls.
         I doubt she wants the traveler to watch stars with her.
         :)
        â””â”€I didn't speak about watching the stars tho ? xD that's another comment. I just think that you can invite a friend to your place at night without wanting to fuck. Especially if it's your birthday, you know, to spend time with them, to make a party or so. But you can headcanon whatever you want. It's just funny to me that a girl inviting a guy to her room is immediately  s e x
          â””â”€I actually relate that last part with her profession but I apologize for making you misunderstood. 
             But yeah, there is a posibility that Mona asked Tabibito to personally come in her house for a treat and then she asked him to get to her bedroom (just as she said in her letter) to talk through the entire night.
             Wagner : Rightttttttttttttt..........
            â””â”€Why would she ask the traveler for money against sex ? Like she is literally one of the proudest characters in the story. She refuses to use her astrology to get money, why would she sell her body and in her birthday at that ? Also it's not like she has no money, she has pretty much a job now. That was the whole point of her story quest. But as I said, if you want to headcanon her doing that kind of "side job" I have nothing against it, it's just that I don't see her that way
              â””â”€I'm pretty sure she just want to break down crying at Tabibito for being broke, probably behind rent payment and she can't keep playing the haughty mage all the time. So she would ask the traveler for some Mora in exchange for her food.
                 She lives far away from most Monstadt playable characters despite being in the city, but Wagner is her neighbour and the first person that everyone's gonna meet for weapon purchase or ore processing for weapon upgrade, so he does hear cries from his home, and it's definitely doesn't sound like a man nor a child.
                 I know the real situation is ambigious, but knowing someone like her, this is a possible reason for the invitation.
                â””â”€Okey fair, I didn't thought about it that way, you are right that it could be a possibility. But I was more commenting on the sexual implications that people gave to her letter, that I personally couldn't see. I was just jarred to see that the fanbase literally explode on a simple letter like that, like that was the one and only possible interpretation to her words xD. Also as someone who is not that interested in sex, I tend to be surprised at the ease of the fandom to make everything dirty. (At to be clear I perfectly understand that people would interpret it that way if they are a Mona x Traveler shipper btw, and I have nothing against it and it's a cute ship. Just that I haven't thought about it that way when I read it)
                  â””â”€I appreciate your innocent first impression. I could wish to go back to those times, to be like you, but the ones I saw were too beautiful to be left behind.
                     The post that got people to react in such a way was the picture of Mona grabbing a razor (with her color palette even) after the letter, which lead to the obvious, undeniable conclusion that everyone who saw it to decide. I will edit this post very soon by including the link because I just got back from work, lying on my mattress and using my currently charged phone to type these.
                     I must say, the ship is beautiful, and the fandom got too carried away.
                     But the letter most certainly didn't help her situation, especially with the suspicious invitation.
                     Edit : Here you go
                     https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Memepact/comments/x23mo4/moana_magistus/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
              â””â”€she's really quite proud, but she almost agreed to live in the teapot so she could save money
    â””â”€Huh. Two vtubers i watch like to "play monopoly" with each other a lot at night.
    â””â”€I mean birthday parties are generally done at night time
      â””â”€Ive always had them around afternoon or a few hours later
      â””â”€[deleted]
        â””â”€Yea idk, Iâ€™m apparently too pure to read into it at first lol
    â””â”€&gt;play monopoly
       Yeah that's the worse way to spend the night.
    â””â”€I meanâ€¦ eat dinner? ðŸ˜…
  â””â”€No, actually I don't know how people interpreted it that way. I mean, I guess it's funny to interpret it sexually. But the people that say it's obviously that probably don't have any close friendship with the opposite gender. Or are horny, which is a high probability with this fandom

This is so good lol


Ah ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…


bruh I saw that message and instantly knew it lmaoo


i mean i can hydrate solely with her drips that she make


Ngl, I think fischl looked hot here


Iâ€™ve never been jealous of anyone in my whole life. Damn traveler better at least hit it right.


Lumine to Albedo: Give a pennis


idk if genshin fans are just extra horny or im dense but I swear I read 0 sexual innuendo or implications in that message
  â””â”€A girl is inviting you to her place, at night and just the two of you... that sounds at least like a date
  â””â”€You'll understand when you grow up


Get a fucking grip. Please, pretty please.


#PLAPSYLVANIA
   Where Moan-uh is heading. Lol.


When the Impostor Is Sus


Bruh that makes me think about how traveler is depicted in fanon as a harem OC, but what about the complete opposite? How come there hasn't been a fanon depiction of Aether where he's completely dense to seggsual references?


Love this art style


As a manga reader i read from right to left unintentionally..


SE-!
