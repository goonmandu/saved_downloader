This is a certified comments section of a Bridget post moment


Nice, i will use that ass to cum deep inside it


What a shitty comment section
  └─Tbh this is usual for reddit. I'm learning japanese so I can browse Pixiv better and not having to deal with people constantly try to gatekeep who gets to be considered a trap even when the own artist's description says their drawing is of one.

She's trans, isn't this sub just for fem presenting men?
  └─[Gonna drop this here since it keeps being brought up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CuteTraps/comments/x0b3pb/comment/im7dxid/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
     TL;DR: Developers (read, the japanese ones, not localizers) never actually said he's trans. In fact the only mention of gender that the description of his character in the site and in the game are stating he's a boy. There's not a single japanese femboy that westerners don't try to claim to be trans and they're wrong the vast majority of the time. 
     In Japan most people acknowledge him as a boy and none of the developers or people who worked in the game seem to ever have stated otherwise. In fact, the literal artist of this picture affirm he's a boy according to his taggings on the pixiv source links.
    └─Least insane Bridget enjoyer
      └─Just don't think people should be gatekeeping traps in a trap subreddit.
        └─I agree, it's just annoying
        └─Except she isn't one, because she's a trans woman.  I'm also a trans woman, and we explicitly don't like being called traps, because it's not only misgendering but also very dehumanising.
          └─Got any actual citation by the developers saying he's a trans woman? Because if you don't, then he's a boy like they always said he was.
            └─It's in the game.  Bridget comes out as a trans girl, the wiki lists her gender as "female".
              └─https://wikiwiki.jp/ggst-memo/%E3%83%96%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B8%E3%83%83%E3%83%88
                 As stated before only english wikis state his gender to be female, the japanese ones only ever call him a boy, or otokonoko. Seems like he doesn't come out as trans and you simply misunderstood it.
              └─What's in the game? For the Japanese playerbase, he doesn't "come out" as trans whatsoever. 
                 You're gonna need an actual confirmation by the developers, not english wiki, if you want to back that up. Otherwise I have no reason to go with an American interpretation of gender that's completely different from a Japanese one, where the game was actually made.
          └─Yeah we're trans not traps. If our goal was to lie to straight men we'd sell nfts
            └─No offense but god damn y’all like to copy paste this joke
            └─Except there's no proof whatsoever Bridget is trans. So trap is completely fine.
    └─If Bridget is a dude then what about the andro symbol on their head and referring to themselves as a girl in the non-flawless ending and in the in-game bio? This stuff is so confusing and only highlights the problem of having these complex characters having to have everything from the source material translated
      └─To understand it, you gotta understand japenese writing system and culture. But since I'm still learning them myself I'm gonna try to make sense as much as possible, and is gonna be a little bit harder for me since english is not my main language so please bare with me.  
         Japanese have a lot of pronouns which are not restricted to male or female, an example is that "Watashi" which means "I/me" is mainly used by females, but males can use Watashi if they feel like it, as well as females using "Boku", the "I/me" mainly used by males. So if Bridget uses Watashi is mainly because of preference.
         &amp;#x200B;
         Now, the Androgynous symbol that Bridget has, is also used by japanese for Genderless fashion, which started in early 2000s but became huge in the mid 2010s, the symbol was used to break societal gender norms in fashion, this is a genderless subculture also known as GNC fashion, a subculture dominated mostly by men, so Bridget using the androgynous symbol means that he represents this subculture fashion which is boys dressing up as girls.
         &amp;#x200B;
         Bridget proclaming that he's a girl in-game can also be part of this japanese culture, GNC boys introducing themselves as girls is part of this fashion because they want and/or love to stay in character as girls or simply they want to pull a prank, which is where the word "trap" comes from.
         &amp;#x200B;
         You can research this information if you don't believe me, also I'm not against trans people wanting to use female pronouns for Bridget, but I just find it a little distasteful that they want to correct anyone about Bridget's pronouns while knowing nothing at all about the character or the culture that he represent.
        └─Really wish the devs would say someone concrete so the arguments can be over already
          └─I'm with you on this, I hope Daisuke(the author of GG) comes out of nowhere to adress this issue, but since this is not a problem in the japenese side, he's probably not aware of it.
            └─It's strange, out of the hundreds of japanese artists I've seen make art of him since his release in Strive, I think I've not seen a single one saying he's a girl. Some might use female honorifics like -chan which don't mean much as they're also commonly used to refer to cute/girly boy characters. This is only really a discussion in the west because of our misunderstanding on their perception of gender and identity.
              └─I think it's because it's not a big deal to them, especially since it could go either way with Bridget depending on how well you play. I think it kinda telling that it's just people in the west that are getting into online squabbles over a possibility.
      └─[It's an androgynous male symbol](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FbtPADDWIAAAvn2?format=png&amp;name=small) due to the way it's slanted. The game bio in japanese only [says he's a guy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FbLnDSlUYAAunyW?format=jpg&amp;name=large) and nothing else. Referring to himself as a girl is, like, the [most common trope](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FbyyeJJXwAEfLAG?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900) for traps.
         If we're going to not allow certain characters to be posted because some people in the west thing they're trans, then you might as well not allow any of them to be posted because there's always someone trying to claim that's the case. Since the authors are the ones that determine a character's gender, you should at least follow what they say, not fan theories.
        └─“I’m a girl”
           &gt;fan theory
           ok cope
          └─Pretty much. The way the dialogue is written, he says 男 to refer to himself as a man, but 女の子 to refer to his femininity. Not 女 or メス. It's formal speech for japanese adults. 
             If it was just that, I'd probably think he was indeed a trans girl. But the fact that all his descriptions sill just say he's a boy in japanese (which are conveniently changed to girl/gender-neutral in english), and that the japanese people don't seem to actually acknowledge him as a girl, makes me think it's just some lost-in-translation meaning for the story. 
             It's particularly weird that ASW Usa stopped even talking about him on their social media, despite Bridget's massive popularity in the west. It just seems that there's something that went wrong indeed, and that they're probably going to make a statement about it sometime soon.
    └─In Strive theres litteraly a cutscene where Bridget says she's a girl, this happens both in the Japanese and English versions of the game so this is just false.
       Also there is no canon ending and I'm so sick of people trying to come up with a canon ending when all of them are canon and are just showing different stories about the characters. Don't gatekeep and argue about them being trans, it just spreads negativity, but also don't try to deny the fact the character is actually trans, the story could've been way better for this change but it's still a change that was made.
      └─Again, the developers never acknowledged him actually being a girl, only the american localizers did. People keep looping back to that cutscene, despite everything that's weird about it, because the true meaning of it seems to have gone over their heads.
        └─Bridget litteraly says "I'm a girl!" what more do you want? A big developer conference where they go "Why yes guys Bridget is trans, wow very cool"
          └─If they meant for him to be trans, they'd have actually made a fleshed out story instead of just relying on the same misgendering gags of old.
            └─You might not like the story but that's how it went, there was no westernization going on, in both Japanese and English Bridget says she's a girl and was happy about it. In the bios and game files she's referred to as a girl, Daisuke has said she's a girl and expressed how progressive he wanted to be. Hell he signed a piece of Bridget artwork with "trans-rights" 3 years ago knowing full well what it meant. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it didn't happen, I don't enjoy how they went about it either but deal with it and accept the fact that Bridget is in fact trans now.
              └─Except the japanese bio says he's a boy, which, you know, is the actual canon.
                 Daisuke literally always said he's a boy with 0 exceptions.
                 The artwork he signed had been on a request from the girl, and he didn't even know what it actually meant because he doesn't speak english.
                 There's enough evidence to support the fact that he's not trans, you just don't wanna bother reading it. If all you got to support otherwise is a cutscene whose meaning went way over your head, then you gotta stop and think that it isn't enough to prove anything.
                └─The Japanese bio says she's a girl, this is just a fact. I know where you got this from and it's been proven false.
                   Daisuke has said she was a boy, yknow when she was a boy. Now that she's a girl he's calling her a girl.
                   The artwork was signed on a request yes, but he also asked the translators what it meant before signing and upon being told what it meant he signed it straight away.
                   I've said and presented more evidence than a single cutscene, and if you haven't seen that by now how are you even reading these comments with that going over your head. I've read everything you've said and it has been disproven time and time again. The cutscene's meaning didn't go over my head, Goldlewis asked if Bridget wanted to be called a cowboy and Bridget responded by saying "I'm a girl!" in both Japanese and English versions. Overall I've been listening to you completely but you don't want to listen to me.
                  └─[This is the japanese bio.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FbLnDSlUYAAunyW?format=jpg&amp;name=large) Feel free to translate the first period, 礼節極まるお嬢様として育て られた、男の子である means "was raised to be a polite young lady, but he is a boy". There's no other mention of gender in the rest of the text.
                     Daisuke has never, and I repeat, never, referred to Bridget as a girl. And you're free to try to find any video of him saying it. In fact, he always always very [firm on his stance](https://twitter.com/MorRoleplay/status/1565308214576418816) that making him a guy was a good idea, given how he became the most popular character in the series because of that.
                     Regardless of whether the translator told him what he meant, it doesn't change the fact that he did that on a request, rather than him sending a message about his views.
                     Without any developer confirmation, all you have is still a cutscene that was never meant to be about coming out whatsoever, and is only about that when viewed from an eurocentric perspective regarding gender.
  └─Up in the air. Apparently that’s just an English side thing, from what I’m told. Apparently, Japanese, still unstated. Again, just from my knowledge. I could be wrong.
    └─Yeah, the only people claiming Bridget is trans are EN localizers and such, as far as I know the devs didn't publish an official statement yet
       Edit: Thanks for the downvotes, very cool. This is what happens when you let a bunch of woke activists on Twitter brainwash you. Or is it just Reddit's hive-mind powers doing the job
      └─The wiki literally says her gender is "female", also Bridget is British, so an English localisation would probably hold more weight regardless.  You're just mad that you can't fetishise her as a trap anymore, because she isn't one.
        └─\&gt;The wiki literally says her gender is "female"
           And in the [japanese guilty gear wiki](https://wikiwiki.jp/ggst-memo/%E3%83%96%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B8%E3%83%83%E3%83%88) he's only called 男の娘 (otokonoko, femboy/crossdresser).
           \&gt;Bridget is British, so an English localisation would probably hold more weight regardless
           That makes no sense whatsoever. It's a japanese game, written by japanese people. It doesn't matter what actual in-universe country the character was born into.
           \&gt;You're just mad that you can't fetishise her as a trap anymore, because she isn't one.
           You seem to be mad you can't fetishize him as being trans, because he isn't one.
        └─https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/jp/character/bgt/
           （男の子である。) - He is a boy.
           - An English localisation would probably hold more weight regardless
           Tbh it's not about the canonical country of origin of the character in this situation, it's what ideological side the translation caters to. So yeah, cheap localizations that show bias on trans activism doesn't really count. Translations are just there to make content more accessible, not to ruin it.
          └─So, making her trans, ruins it?  Lovely perspective you've got there.
            └─No, but forcing headcanon on him does. I am not at all against the trans community as a whole, just mad at the specific people who feel the need to shove their gender stuff down everyone's throats, just because the author hasn't explicitly clarified yet. If you are a transgender (or LGBT supporter in general), I want you to atleast understand that there are better ways for representation. You can make your own trans character or request an artist to make one for you. All of these solutions (and probably more that I haven't mentioned) are way more productive than just shoehorning said identity on an existing character.
              └─The same old argument, "make your own trans character", guess what we fucking did and her name is Bridget.  It's not headcanon, it's in the game.  If you don't like it, tough.
                └─funny they say this and then if it happens there gonna be like “theyre shoving it down our throats” n be rly mad
                  └─I get that y’all  like bridget as a trans character but please if they like her as a boy just skip the damn post and let people enjoy things


I wish I could gape like him 😳
  └─*her
    └─This is a trap subreddit, for crossdressing boys. The artist of this image also states him being a guy. Contradicting the very artist about the picture they've drawn seems stupid.
    └─[deleted]
      └─I agree with you that this sub is for femme guys, but the character this game is from is almost certainly trans, the company she’s from haven’t made an official statement, but she does have lines in the English version explicitly calling herself a girl
        └─Fun fact: Referring to oneself as a girl is kinda one of the most common/typical stuff that femboys do, mostly for playful/comedic purposes
          └─I've never met a irl femboy who didn't joke about being a girl, either. And this is even more common in japanese manga/anime/games. So to claim that this specific example is serious requires some actual confirmation by the developers.


The amount of people not wanting to accept Bridget is a girl makes me actually dizzy like they came out as a trans girl in both the English and Japanese versions, please calm yourself. The story for the change isn't the best but it was a change that was made and you really have no choice but to accept it.


Why the fuck are people suddenly so up in arms about Bridget?


brisket :)
