The thing that makes Venti so cute in hentai is how he acts, not his looks. Sure, he's cute, but if he didn't have the horny, playful personality that people give him, he would not be *nearly* as popular of a bottom boy.
  â””â”€Thats a fair point, personality is what makes the looks matter right?
    â””â”€Yep, if you don't have the right personality and attitude, you'll only get attention from people who only want a quick fuck without thinking about how you feel. Plus, being attracted to someone's personality affects your attraction to them physically.
      â””â”€Umm, i hope im being quirky or something then haha
        â””â”€Lol, here's advice from a top to you: if you wanna get fucked, make it known to the one's you trust and you want to fuck you. Nothing hotter than when a bottom begs for it.


I donâ€™t think you need to be that cute for a top to take interest. I think itâ€™s more important to be kind and respectful. Physical beauty fades over time. Inner beauty can present itself no matter how you appear on the outside.
  â””â”€Thats wise but, venti is still cuter than me
    â””â”€Even if that is true, it doesnâ€™t mean every man in the world has decided you are not beautiful.
       Comparing yourself to fictional character is almost always going to lead to feeling bad. They are draw as idealized versions of what the artist thinks is their version of beautiful, or strong, or whatever traits they choose to present in their art.
      â””â”€I get that but, i dunno, i just, feel i could be somehow cuter haha
        â””â”€I am willing to bet you are actually fairly cute. Most people think too little of themselves these days. Mass media pushes ideals of certain body types. Celebrities show off their looks, but fail to tell people they have a personal chef and trainer.
           The best thing you can do for yourself is learn to love how you look right now. Then if you want to make changes to you appearance, you move forward from there.
           And as for meeting other peopleâ€¦ just live your life. Go to school or work. Spend your spare time maintaining the relationships with people who care about you and support you, and just be open to meeting new people.
           Learn a language, train yourself in any skill- a form of art, the ability to create or repair something, or maybe a sport or game.
           The more you learn, the more well rounded you become as a person. And while you are learning these new things, people will notice the changes in how you carry yourself and your confidence in yourself.
           Then, when you are in the middle of living your life, you will likely meet someone you didnâ€™t expect to- or maybe you will find a relationship with someone has changed or grown into more.
           Thatâ€™s how so much of life happensâ€¦ when we are making other plans, or in the middle of something else. You are going to be ok. Just give it time.
          â””â”€Thing is i already learned another language, i already do a sport, and i still feel with trobles, live dosnt stop hiting you with constant problems you know? I will never be totally, happy, i can take the advice on the looks yes, but i cant really have one method with life, i need to improvise the the way, cus no matter how much money i have, no matter how good at life i will get, i will always have poblems, so no bigge really
            â””â”€Just to be clear, learning a language, etc. was just examples of living life. I wasnâ€™t saying you have to do those specific things.
               There are always going to be problems. Life is fair. People say it isnâ€™t. But it isâ€¦ because anyone can get hit with multiple problems on any given day. And there is no one on Earth that hasnâ€™t had it happen to them unless the were actually born yesterday.
               And one of the things that can be hardest about when you are in the middle of your own struggles- is that it seems like everyone around you is doing much better.
               We are not. Everyone you know is dealing with at least one thing- often multiple problems. But we donâ€™t know about it because they havenâ€™t told us. Maybe they donâ€™t tell us because they donâ€™t want to make us worry, or they donâ€™t want people to see how panicked they are when they are alone.
               And Iâ€™m not saying that everyone has problems and that means that you should just deal with it. What I am saying is that we are all struggling at times. Happiness is something that life makes us fight for.
               You can do it. Every time you overcome something that life hands you, every time you solve a problem - itâ€™s a victory worth celebrating. And those victories make you stronger than you realize.
               You can be happy. It isnâ€™t easy for any of us. But I believe you are strong enough to find some happiness for yourself


Doesn't matter how you look,you can be the cutest thing out there and not have a cute personality. But you have adorable personality which makes you even more wanting by many &lt;3.


Even if the look is important, since it is the first thing people actually see, what hooks it's the personality.
   Either way, I would fuck you, doesn't matter how you look like
  â””â”€Fair enough


Youâ€™re not wrong
  â””â”€The part of venti is cute or the part of not being cute or the part of if i was like venty so many guys would want to fuck me.
