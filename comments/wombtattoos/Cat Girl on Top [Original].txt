Can someone translate what these symbols means?
  └─The ones on the right?  Those are tally marks.  Five counts each.  How many times she has done it.
    └─Thanks!
    └─The last one is only 3 marks, not that it makes much of a difference.
      └─Yeah, that's how tally works.  Each line = 1.  Five max each for ease of reading.
