Haihai\~ I see your post is both marked as NSFW and a spoiler. If this was your intention, great! However, Reddit tends to have a bug where some NSFW posts get a spoiler tag against the posters intention. You can delete the spoiler tag like this: [PC](https://i.imgur.com/NbuuZwk.png) / [Mobile](https://i.imgur.com/dHtwq8A.jpg).
