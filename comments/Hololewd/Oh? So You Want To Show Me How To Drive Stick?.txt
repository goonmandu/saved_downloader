The irony here is she would just be fucking with us because she already knows how and just wants to do the deed

Aight so your gona mash the clutch in while holding the break and pull the stick to first then feather the trothel and let off the clutch till it catches then your going
  └─Feathering the throttle is just gonna make it harder for a new driver to find the clutch bite point imo. 
     Hit gas till around 2k rpms then ease up on the clutch till you feel it catch. hold there until about 5 mph then come off clutch.
    └─Ah yes, I completely understand this conversation, fellow clutchkin
      └─Automatics were created for a reason, I push gas, it goes, ez
    └─I guess that's fair, well a new clutch ain't that bad.
      └─Speak for yourself, I've spent too many of my days replacing clutchs, it's no walk in the park
    └─Yeah personally this is the best way as it prevents the engine from completely stalling.
  └─Thanks


(quick reminder for many Europeans and all Americans: This car is made for left hand drive, which is why there's no driver's seat on the left side of the car.)

    └─Dz nuts!


Traction control off, clutch in, rev to 6k, let go of the clutch as fast as you possibly can, smash the gas, and while you're smashing the gas as hard as you can, shift through the gears.
   To slow down, you just shift from your highest gear to your lowest.


I misread that as something completely different


My family requires us to learn stick even if our car is automatic.


Can't rlly be showing her how to drive stick when she's not even on the side with a wheel.


She’s obviously trying to trick you, from the center console it looks like it’s an automatic


bitch you can’t drive for shit let go of the stick
