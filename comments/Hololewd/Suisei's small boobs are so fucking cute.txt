Small boobs are nice
  └─Indeed


I can't handle such mouthwatering total flatness...


Hey a woman’s boobs are boobs wether small or big they are one of the national treasures of man
  └─The wonderful softness is appreciated no matter the size
    └─Indeed. Along with the other national treasures it is the best
  └─Yeah, like a wise man said "All size makes the cocks rise."
     Pettan or P-cups, all the Hologirls have a place in our hearts. Suiseu and Gura especially.
    └─Indeed, we may have differences but when it comes to breast everyone agrees. “ all sizes makes the cocks rise”


This is AI-generated btw. The artist's pixiv account is only a day old and most of their works (but not this one for some reason) have the novelAI tag.
  └─Damn AI art is becoming this good already?
    └─Well AI art right now afaik just takes a bunch of sample images matching the tags you want and then kinda splicing them together it really isn't creating anything from scratch technically
      └─Bullshit, that's absolutely not how it works, no AI works that way. The crux of the whole field is learning the representations. No images is retained by the AI, instead they are compressed, then scrambled. The AI then tries to guess what the original image would look like. The only thing retained by the AI is the steps taken to denoise the image
        └─Oh shit are you the guy who made the AI? No? Just some tech bro? But not one that's actually good at tech mostly just like a guy that plays video games. Damn that's crazy bro.
           Since you know so much about AI art generation, can you please explain why there are so many examples of the art having markedly traceable elements of other people's work in it? Things like watermarks, faces, the cover art from bloodborne, stock imagery, etc? Like how are you gonna say "no image is retained" when you can literally track the images. It's just difficult to do so because there's so much art out there. Your inability to find the source art is not the same thing as there not being source art.  
           For example this generation which is Lexica, a Stable Diffusion model AI https://twitter.com/kortizart/status/1565941015877279744/photo/1

    └─Well it’s as good as the artists it copies… AI can’t « create » anything, but it’s gotten quite good at recreating (from input for example of 1000 « suisei 18+ » images)
      └─I mean… I don’t care if it copied artists if it pretty much allows me to commission nice lewds for free
        └─"I don't care if it completely destroys the art market through stolen art"
  └─Shit I didn't notice, I'll keep look more carefully next time. Thanks
  └─That explains the shading...
  └─Why would you care whether lewd art is AI generated?
    └─I don't, I'm just flexing my ability to identify AI-generated artwork because it makes me feel smart.
      └─damn straight
      └─But you didn't even do that, you just stalked the guy's pixiv, lmao.
      └─So then smarty, how DID you identify that this is AI-made?
  └─Oh god actually? Do you know any generators that does similar?
  └─y'know what? AI's got some impeccable taste I'll tell you hwat.
  └─Which at art program was used though?


Nothing like a Cutting Board chest 👍
