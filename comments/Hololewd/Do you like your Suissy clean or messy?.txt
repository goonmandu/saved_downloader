thats it, im travelling back in time to stop the first person to put -ussy after a noun
  └─It's the worst fucking meme trend in recent memory. A short list of words I have seen feral internet users -ussify.
     Elon Musk's mother - Muskussy
     The Pokemon, Raichu - Raichussy
     An actual capybara - Capybussy
     My own username that is already an innuendo - Stiffussy
    └─Stiffussy 🥴 got me weak in knees 🥵
      └─My weird, boner pussy does have that affect on people.
        └─Bonussy 🥵
    └─Can you also get the person who invented “badussy” too?
       I cant help but vomit every time i hear someone use it.
    └─Another one I've heard was towards Mr Krabs. Krussy
      └─Ah, I hate it!
  └─First time I heard about it was "orcussy", of course referring to Chloe
  └─OK, but let clussy still exist
  └─I don’t know where the heck it originated from but it’s so funny.

Do people legit enjoy getting a mouth full of hair when going down on a girl?
  └─Well, my dentist did recommend flossing after every meal
  └─I don't know about the practicality. I just like the way it looks.
  └─You'd be suprise
  └─*Sometimes* you may end up with a hair in your mouth but it's not often once you get the hang of it. On the other side, they have to deal with our hairy, sweaty cock and balls so I'd say it's a fair trade.
     I love a hairy pussy, it doesn't make me confused as to whether I fuck a minor or not and it rustles my primordial urges, making me wanna breed her hard...
    └─Idk about girls but by the age of 15 i had full metal bush. So hair doesn't indicate on adulthood.
       Also shave your balls, it feels really really good.
    └─I mean, I usually trim myself often.  And I get the attractiveness of some bush.  Just in this case, it looks like the amazon rainforest down there.
  └─Hey, you hear a lady complain when she’s going down on you and your hairy bush?
     Didn’t think so.
    └─I groom myself as well thank you very much.
       I would hope other gentlemen do the same.
  └─I ain’t that picky.
  └─Right? Hairy just looks so unhygienic.
    └─I dont like hair but hair there is literally the opposite of unhygienic, pubic hair traps sweat, dirt and harmful bacterial and actually produces sebum which prevents bacteria from reproducing making said harmful things not reach your privates, Not liking something doesn’t mean its unhygienic, I get that in western cultures there a shit ton of myths about body parts an example being foreskin being unhygienic but you should search something up before saying something stupid.
      └─I said it *looks* unhygienic. I didn't say it *is* unhygienic. It looks gross *to me.*


Enthusiastically Consenting


Suissy 😳. Last pic is edited by an anonymous cultured person. Here, take the hot [suisauce](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/90127265)
  └─But do you know where you found it op? 
     I would like to check the anonymous hero's other honorable works


Clean. Personal preference.


clean


Bro the hair colour doesn’t even match
  └─Probably because she's in a shade......
  └─I hate colored pubic hair


OP where did you find the pantiless version?


That clean shot just looks sooooo damn good, I wanna eat!


&gt;blue hair
   &gt;black pubes
   seems legit


Its one thing when you have a few pubes, but when its covered by pubes i dont like it.


Sauce?


Anything than can suisex


the carpet does not match the drapes.


I don’t know why artists keep coloring  the holomembers’ pubes black... as if they aren’t fantasy characters who might actually have natural hair color.


Messy so the suipiss will be filtered
