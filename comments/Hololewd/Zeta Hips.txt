Sauce?
  └─[deleted]
    └─Already did, there were no link(s), although there's a comment that was deleted
      └─Okay, there is a Sauce now, moderator has approved. Sadly no info about Pixiv or Twitter or anything else :/
        └─FYI, "modder" is different from "mod", which is short for "moderator", someone who arbitrates discussion and, in the sense used online, acts as a censor as well, determining what content is and isn't allowed; the former, "modder", means "someone who modifies", as in, someone who writes code to modify a game, or who makes aftermarket parts to swap out components, be it in a car, a table, a computer, whatever.
          └─Sorry my English isn't perfect
            └─Yup, that's why I was giving you the information on the difference! English slang can be pretty confusing, especially when it's built around words (especially shortened words) that have multiple potential meanings, conjugations, and prefixes and suffixes that can change the meaning entirely.


For the interested, that's a koikatsu scene.
  └─I wonder where I can find it? (And Zeta’s model?)

  └─I haven't been on this sub in a while...
     I thought source = a single page where the artist and his/her artwork is clearly defined?
    └─I was trying to found that page, but there is nothing like that, so i asked modders for help. Because we dont found anything else, they accept this source as an exception. Otherwise Bot will remove the link.
    └─3d porn is often made and posted directly to 4chan
    └─It is, normally.
       But sometimes artists either delete their posts or just downright disappear from the internet, and the only things left hosting their stuff are boorus and other hosting links.
      └─Or they don't post it to non-anonymous locations as well! While this specific site isn't the original source per se, just having the links to the partially clothed and nude animations, the catbox links there (that host the animations) are indeed the originals, as far as I can determine. The artist is Wataamage (or an anon that contributed to them? "Home grown and anonymously contributed Vtuber Koikatsu lewds." from their Twitter profile), as can be confirmed by comparing other art they have done featuring Zeta; thanks to u/blimpniffa for putting me on the track to them and being able to compare their work to the animation above. Bonus: Wataamage also posts the HQ versions of animations to catbox, so it's likely that is the original hosting of the animation; it just wasn't posted to their Twitter or other art-sharing locations.
      └─I had been meaning to ask this, but what is the lore behind the booru websites? I had only been using pixiv until I saw all those danbooru gelbooru sites

  └─From the source noted in Rule34, here's THEIR sources;
     clothed: files(dot)catbox(dot)moe/lhwca9.webm
     nude: files(dot)catbox(dot)moe/uw20cb.webm
     Possibly the original sources, uploaded there by the artist, but it's a free file host that doesn't share any further information, so it dead-ends there. Attempting to reverse image search only brings you to this thread (at least as of posting this). (replace "(dot)" with "."; non-whitelisted-domains-as-links get your comment deleted, apparently)
    └─I was hoping that author has some pixiv or twitter. If there is no more info, there is nothing we can do. I was also searching Google, but there was nothing aswell... Oh well, thank you very much.
      └─They might, but RIS functions are intended primarily for static images, not animations, so trying to find animations is very hard. Usually you only get the thumbnail search, and that usually works to find THEIR thumbnail, but if it doesn't show up... you're just SOL.
      └─We have a (potential?) source! Thanks to u/blimpniffa, it's most likely Wataamage (or one of the anon contributors? Not sure how to read the description of, "Home grown and anonymously contributed Vtuber Koikatsu lewds."; does that mean that they get lewds given to them anonymously, or is it because they themselves remain anonymous behind their pseudonym?) due to the art style of the model and other art they have shared, including stuff that features the exact same model of Zeta, as well as the fact that animations they post are also posted to Catbox for the HQ versions, which is where the final source of those animations lies.
    └─I know the source
      └─Then give it instead of bragging about it?
        └─My bad I saw it somewhere but have forgot the artist's name. It's 'wataaamage'. Not sure why he didn't post this on his twitter
          └─Yeah looking at their art, it definitely seems of the same sort of thing that they'd make. Bonus, they do indeed post the HQ versions of animations to catbox as well, so I'm pretty sure that those links above are the original source, too! If we look at other art of theirs, featuring Vestia Zeta, as well, it's a 1:1 with the model in this animation as well, eg. https://rule34.xxx/index.php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=6783252
          └─Could be on their Discord...
