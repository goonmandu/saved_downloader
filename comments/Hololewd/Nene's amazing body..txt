This is so good, pretty accurate, except for nerfed Lamy, but that NePoLaBo hug is both hot and wholesome.
  └─A rarity compared to all the times she's buffed
  └─Nerfed isn't the right term, but honestly, seeing one of the girls smaller has some novelty to it, since 99% of hentai makes girls bigger, unfortunately
    └─It is in this particular instance. Lamy’s boobs are literally the most endowed out of everybody except Noel. She is certainly bigger than Botan.
      └─I mean that smaller =/= nerfed. Nerfed is when something becomes worse, but smaller isn't worse.


That might be one of the best AI pieces I've seen so far thanks to the composition work.
  └─Holy shit, this is AI? The faces are perfect.
     Edit: It seems to be by the artist who regularly does accurate faces in his lewds. Idk how exactly the AI was used cause I’m pretty sure this guy can still draw. Maybe he drew over it?
    └─Oh I've seen this guy's work before. He draws over Koikatsu stuff too. In fact it looks like he used Koikatsu for faces and stuff in this image as well. Simply calling it AI is demeaning to the actual work put into it.
      └─Now this is how it should be used.
         Although not knowing this and only seeing the single tag on the pixiv does obscure that info.
      └─I really dig the style. The faces make it 👌
      └─I hate when artists look down on AI art in general. It's a tool like anything else, and to be honest, I doubt that Renaissance painters would respect art made in Photoshop very much. They might be blown away by the tech, but I don't think they would respect it as art.
    └─I love how many times I've been outright *attacked* on Reddit in the last two weeks for saying this is exactly what was going to happen. AIGI is literally the future for almost all industries, even traditional artists. 
       People have been acting like it's absurd to say that many "traditional digital artists" were going to start using AI generated art as the base and then edit it from there to look how they wanted. It's especially funny to me, because "digital artists" was just as controversial 15 years ago as saying "AI artist" is now, where the art gate keepers screamed that digital art / photography / colored pencils etc weren't "real art"
      └─Then they tried going from traditional to digital and realized it still takes massive amount of work, because you need a different skill set. But both kinds of artists had to learn theory such as: anatomy, colour theory, composition, lighting, backgrounds, etc. I, as an artist, don't care if you use it as a base layer. It skips a process that would take ~30-60 minutes out of the multiple hour drawing/painting and artists like shortcuts. I personally like the "figuring out the poses and such" part of the art process, however, I understand a lot of artists like jumping straight into the colouring and detailing.
         The problem lies in the people inputting words into the AI, which then rips apart art pieces from multiple artists without their consent, stitches them together into an image and gives it the equivalent of an Instagram filter. These so called artists take that image, post it as their own, and, if stars align, deny AI was ever used.
        └─Stop spreading misinformation


I need Nene to ride my face.


Small boobs Lamy😧

  └─Needs to be AI flaired, tagged as #NovelAI
    └─The artist who posted it still has a bunch of other high quality art you can see on his account. He does some of the best, accurate faces I’ve seen. Not just AI stuff.
      └─Yes I follow the artist on Pixiv and enjoy their work. This piece is too good to be just AI and is likely some combination of AI and the artist’s own handiwork. However it is tagged #NovelAI and should be flaired here accordingly.


The AI nerfed Lamy


definitely the best AI work I've seen


Damn this is some seriously hot stuff right here.


always happy to see more nene content on here


Wanna blow raspberries on her tummy


We can argue about AI opinions later, but for now, this is by far my favorite Nene lewd I have ever seen. The expressions are adorable, her proportions look spot on, and the overall composition is very nice.


high quality


Wow.


👍👍👍👍👍


Sugoi so much oppai


"When has she been this stacked"
   *Gun click* "Always has been"


I've seen pretty good AI art before, but this is something else.


Cute waif


Damn! Forget the horny! This is so well drawn!!!


Quick question: is there a link to this AI art generator?
