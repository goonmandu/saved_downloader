Tell me, really.. what is the purpouse of this dress?
  └─Easier access
    └─Have you ever gone to a park as a kid and tried to poke your fingers theough those metal tables with the holes in them? That's what I'm remided of.
      └─Lmao
  └─Baiting chimkins into getting themselves sent to the usual room
  └─sechs
  └─To make you LOOK LIKE you are wearing clothes.
  └─To make the tree branch stiffer and stronger.

Source to the alt versions?
  └─Follow the Pixiv link. All versions are posted there.
    └─Ah mb, I normally follow the artist on twitter so I don’t usually see the alts.
      └─No worries. That's why I try to post both sources because not everyone is on both, but yeah sometimes there are spicier versions that don't make it to twitter.


I feel alive
