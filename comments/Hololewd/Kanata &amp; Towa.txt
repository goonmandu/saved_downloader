r/MensSwimsuitChallenge is a nice thing to see

Free the Nipple!


Heaven...or heaven?


Haven't seen a men's swimsuit challenge art in a while.

ngl it does feel less lewd with men's swimsuit. Guess it just don't hit lol
  └─Same. It just feels... off. If I found a microbikini art of Kanata of a similar quality, I'd be all over it in a second, but men's swimsuit just doesn't do it for me at all.


Welp, now I'm hard


Oh my what kawaii little shojos… let’s play…


The camera angle and mildly disappointed expressions make me wonder what happened. It's like some series of chaotic events ended with you unconscious on the beach in front of Kanata and Towa with them wondering just how the heck we ended up like this.


Makes me wonder what Bibi will become.
