Why does she not bathe? That's surely unhealthy
  └─Honestly, this is probably something the fanbase has blown out of proportion. I'm sure she bathes, but if you're working from home all day- as a vtuber, in her case- sometimes you miss a couple days. I don't remember the conversation where this cropped up word for word, so I might be wrong, but I'm guessing she'd just gone a few days without bathing when Lui came over. I can't imagine she *never* bathes.
  └─she might just take showers instead, cheaper and quicker so that's what i do. maybe she doesn't have a bath, i've heard some people don't even bother getting them installed because they just take showers.
  └─Neglectful parenting or nothing they can do because her body has a high tolerance level, which is unhealthy.
    └─what
    └─🙏bro said something about it being unhealthy
    └─High tolerance to what? Soap? You're not making any sense.
      └─My b. You see,  everyone has different kind of skin. For ex. Thin/sensitive skin = low tolerance to dirtiness. You can feel itchy, disgusting, sticky, etc. 
         While thick skin will have high tolerance, meaning they won't feel itchiness, stickiness, etc.  As much.
         As a result of high tolerance skin, you'll be less likely to take care of yourself(take baths in this case) because you don't feel the urgency as badly as low tolerating skin.
        └─I doubt there’s such a thing as high tolerance skin. At least in my experience, when you forgo showering for a while you get used to it. When you’ve been showering frequently for a while missing even one day is quickly felt, because you’re used to the feeling of clean skin
  └─Has to be some sort of mental issue or a disorder. She has shown extremely illegible handwriting from time to time, beyond being not so good at it.
    └─Not disrespecting you, but mental issue and disorders are more serious than that. Unless you count laziness as a mental disorder of some kind. But it's not like she needs therapy or anything of the like.
       Bad handwriting is a normal thing. I've never seen anything off about the way she thinks and she plays games just fine.
      └─[This level of bad handwriting](https://twitter.com/sakamatachloe/status/1550057215238684672) [is legit dysgraphia](https://twitter.com/sakamatachloe/status/1545730229183819777) . You wouldn’t know unless you are Japanese fluent, but she’s having topologies wrong, substituting horizontal/vertical lines with diagonals and out of place, those aren’t normal. 
         Judging by google search results, it looks like certain kinds of developmental coordination disorder don’t like having baths because it’s just hard for them. That’ll be consistent with her handwriting. 
         And lastly, “laziness isn’t disorder” is just not so respectful. It can very well be result of one. Disorder isn’t like a condition of a deformed man making grumbling noise at the side of a road, that’ll be like 18th century definition of disorders.
        └─In this case, it's better not to psycho analyze people. You're honestly creepy. You actually go a little too far. I want to think you're not a bad person, but you should lay off on trying to figure her out.
           She's fine as she is. She has no real problems. And if she does, that's her own private life to deal with, that has nothing to do with us. We're just random people on the internet that have no impact on her life whatsoever, so just stop.
           I'm just here to look at cute girls, meme, and troll in the comments. Ooo stinky girl doesn't bathe for 5 days. Boo hoo. Ooo bad handwriting boo hoo. Have some fun in your life, like Chloe and La+ interactions in the link you gave.
