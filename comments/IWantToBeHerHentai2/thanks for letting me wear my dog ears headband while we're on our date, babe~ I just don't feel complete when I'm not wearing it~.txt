    └─*I wrap my arms around you, hugging you tight* I love you~
      └─I love you too~ so, what's next for our date?~
        └─I think we should go back home, it’s getting late and I have a present for you
          └─Alright~ I can't wait~
            └─*I hold your hand and walk back home with you* I really liked our date, you picked a nice restaurant~
              └─I'm glad you liked it
                 *I smile happily*
                └─*I unlock the front door and walk inside our home before going straight to our room*
                   (Brb, I’ve got to feed my cat)
                  └─*I wait for you to come back*


"That's why I always keep it with me.. I also noticed this morning that the *other* dog accessory was missing, mind telling me where it went\~?"
  └─*I blush, turning around and lifting my skirt*
    └─"Wait.. You put it on didn't you! Naughty pup! Stealing master's present before I give it to you\~" *My hand reaches under your skirt and playfully tugs at the plug.*
      └─*I moan quietly as you tug on it*
         W-wait... "master"?...
        └─"W-Well you've accidentally called me that a few times I don't think you ever noticed, I just thought you liked calling me that.."
          └─W-well I wouldn't be opposed to having an owner...
             *I blush*
            └─"Since you like it so much.. out here you'll be my girlfriend and at home you can be my adorable little pet, what do you think?"
              └─I'd love that~
                └─"Alright, now I wanna get home early.. what do you think\~?"
                  └─Sure~


It's no problem babe~ I think they look good on you~
   *I hug you and start scratching your head*
  └─*I blush as you scratch my head, enjoying the sensation*
    └─Are you my good girl?~ Do you like getting head scratches?~
       *I tease as I keep scratching before kissing your cheek*
      └─Y-yes, I'm your good girl
        └─You're such a good girl~ You wanna go for a walk now?~
          └─Ok~
            └─Let's go~ We'll get you a collar and a leash on the way if you want~
               *I pull you in for a kiss before grabbing your hand and walking with you*
              └─*I kiss you back, following you*
                └─If you're a good girl then I'll get you a special treat too~
                   *I hold your hand tight as we walk into the shopping district*
                  └─Ok, I'll be a good girl


Anything for my special girl~ besides I love how happy you look with them on!
   *i wrap my arm around you enjoying the ice cream I bought as we walk through the fair*
  └─*I smile, licking my ice cream and hugging you*
    └─So what ride do you want to go on next? There’s the ferris wheel, the tea cups…
       *As I’m rambling on we pass a stall of a carnival game, with a sign out front, “knock the 3 milk bottles down and win a prize” the shelf was lined with plushies ranging from lions to bears, there was even a plushie of a cute pink dog with fluffy ears and a tail*
      └─*I look at the prizes*
        └─*I notice you look as we stop walking and smile at you*
           See anything you like? 
           *I lean in close and whisper in your ear teasingly*
           If you ask nicely I might win it for you~
          └─P-please could you win me a prize?...
            └─Of course babe~ hold this for me
               *I hand you my ice cream and kiss you on the cheek as I walk over to the stall*
               One game please…
               *I hand the man in charge of the game some money and he passes me back a ball, explaining the rules of the game, *You get 3 throws to knock down all three pins, if even one is left standing you get no prize*, I manage to knock the top bottle and one of the lower ones down in one shot, the second causing the bottle to wobble but stays stood up, the third hits the bottle clean off, *And we have a winner! What’ll it be kid?**
               I’ll take the pink dog please
               *He hands me the plushie and I walk back to you offering it back to you*
               As promised one cute plush for my cute pup~
              └─*I blush as you call me your pup, taking the plush and smiling*
                 Thanks
                └─Now then… 
                   *I wrap my arms around your waist and pull you close to me as I look down at you smiling*
                   What prize did I win, my little puppy~? Or were you expecting that plushie to be for free~~
                  └─*I take out a black leather collar from my bag, handing it to you and blushing*


Oh! N-No worries…Although, I don’t really understand it, I’m glad you’re happy! *I exclaim, a wide, confused yet comforting grin plastered across my face.*
  └─*I smile, hugging you*
    └─*I hug back, thinking of something mischievous. I then pat your head gently, scratching the back of the ears ever so lightly before asking,* Who’s a good girl? Who’s a good girl? Tell me~
      └─*I answer excited*
         I am~
         *I blush slightly*
        └─*Hearing that and seeing you in this way makes me feel warm inside, almost a little too warm and so I whisper in your ear.*
           And who’s good girl are you?
          └─Y-yours...
            └─Exactly! I think a good girl like you deserves a reward for knowing that~
               *I tease, my hand moving down to your necklace and softly tugging on it, bringing you closer to me.*
              └─*I lean closer to you*
                └─*I then press a kiss to your cheek before my hand moves to tug at your shirt.*
                   Perhaps this little pet wants to be closer with their master. Would I be wrong in assuming that?
                  └─No, master~ you wouldn't~


I see nothing wrong with it so why not right? \*I smile and kiss your cheek\*
  └─*I smile, hugging you*
    └─\*I hug back and chuckle a little\* I love you so much babe
      └─I love you too~
         *I kiss your cheek*
        └─\*I kiss your cheek again\* So did you want to go sit on the docks and enjoy the sunset like we planned or do you want to do something else?
          └─Whatever you want~
            └─Well how about we head home then, and enjoy a special sunset from there babe\~ \*I hold you closer and smirk a little\*
              └─Alright~ let's go~
                └─\*I kiss you on the lips before wrapping and arm around your waist\* alright then\~ \*I chuckle a little before I start walking with you back home\*
                  └─*as we walk home, my attention is drawn to a pet store, blushing slightly as I look at it*


Of course you look cute with 'em on anyway. In fact I have a few ideas swimming around
  └─What sort of ideas?
    └─Wondering how much cuter you'd look if we upped the look
      └─Upped the look how?~
        └─Maybe I slip a cute little collar round your neck for one
          └─I'd like that~
            └─Maybe I'll get you a little leash as well and give it a nice tug while I'm behind and deep inside you
