I wouldn’t say saved, more like, under new management
  └─Ah yes mega mind memes


Of course, anything to stick it to those assholes *I say leading you inside*
  └─C-can you take off the collar from me now?
    └─I could. But I think it's best to wait a bit *I bring you fully inside and close the door behind you*
      └─O-okey then but can you at least detach the leash?
        └─...we'll see, how was all that time with the traffickers anyway?
          └─It-it was terrible I was abused and beaten regularly *I say looking scared*
            └─Well that's over for you you're in a much better place now *I say petting your head*
              └─B-but my mom and dad is probably worried *gets up* (sorry I thought it was someone else who commented I fucked it up my bad)
                └─Probably, but we'll cross that bridge later for now I'm curious, did you go through any training with them?
                  └─*nods and curls up looking quite traumatized*


... saving?


Of course darling. They were rather mean after all.
  └─*hugs you tightly* I owe you my life
    └─*Hugs you close as I pull you inside and close the door* Yes, you do.
      └─C-can you take off the collar from me?
        └─Oh? Is it not comfy? *Pets your head gently as I guide you to a couch*
          └─N-no not really
            └─*Undoes the collar and slowly pulls it off of you after I've sat you down and sits down next to you* Better?
              └─Y-yes thank you sir
                └─*Pets your head gently* Of course darling.
                  └─C-can I go back to my family now?

Any time ^^ wanna come have some food? Safe place to live?
  └─ but I couldn’t ask that of you after you saved me I’ll be fine
    └─You sure? I don’t want you to get hurt again


No need for the "Sir" stuff. How about you call me "Daddy" instead to make you feel more at home? 😊
  └─W-what no please say you’re actually saving me *starts backing off* y-you didn’t actually buy me r-right?
    └─Hey hey, calm down. You can go back to your family. I just figured we can get you a meal and a bath first, make you look in good condition so your family doesn't worry.
       *I get closer and place my hand gently on your lower back.*
       "Let's take a bath with Daddy, alright?"
      └─N-no I can bathe on my own sir


Oh don't worry it's no problem at all so just come in~~


It was nothing dear I only wish I could have saved you sooner *I said helping you inside 
   *


Could we play this out in dms?
  └─Sure just don’t ask any questions and just do the rp in DMs


*I quickly usher you in through the door closing it behind us, i let out a deep sigh before looking down at you as you thank me*
   “O-oh it’s nothing really…it’s actually my job…I’m a police officer you see and I’ve been investing the human trafficking ring in this city…so now your safe, see I’m one of the good guys”
   *I reach into my back pocket and pull out my police badge, i let you look at it while I take off my black cap and jacket hanging it up in the closet, before turning back to you*
  └─*I hug you and snuggles into your chest* th-thank you sooo much please let me repay you in anyway possible even sexual if you want idc
    └─*Im shocked by your hug and sudden outburst, I’ve never had to deal with a victim like this so I wasn’t expecting in my element, I slowly hug you back and pat your head*
       “N-no no that’s alright…u-um listen you don’t have to live like that anymore…besides I don’t think that would be appropriate…let’s just get you all settled and feeling safe again ok?”
      └─N-no sir please let me stay with you *clings onto you tightly*
        └─“W-well I guess that would be the safest option right now wouldn’t it…u-um okay then you can stay here with me for a little bit then…”
           *I pull you off of me so i can kneel down in front of you giving you a pat on the head*
           “Well since you’ll be staying here I’m Chris what’s your name? Those people didn’t exactly have a name for you other than ‘merchandise’ which is awful”
          └─Yk I’m not a child *i pout* you don’t have to treat me like one just cause I’m short
            └─“Th-that’s not what I mean~ Im just trying to be nicer cause you know…those other guys were awful so I’m just showing I’m a good guy…so your name? Im gonna need it for my report…”
              └─My names Luna Glacie


don't worry good girl I will not let anyone harm you
   I am a doctor I will do a full body check to make sure they haven't hurt you


"Saved" huh? Not the word I'd use. But... you're welcome nontheless.
  └─Hm okey then so can you take off the collar now?
    └─Not yet. *I lead you inside the house. You see me yake out a tool case* Okay. Turns out you've a bomb on there.
      └─bros a bomber☠
      └─W-WHAT!?
        └─Yeah. Hold still. *I begin working on the collar* So... how long were you with them?
          └─F-for 6 years
            └─That's a long time... you've any parents? Whoops... *You hear beeping* Okay. Do not panic. You still have any parents?
              └─*I start panicking anyways* y-yes I do
                └─*The beeping gets faster* Really? Know if they're still around?
                  └─N-no I don’t *starts crying as I’m scared*


*My ear flicked as you walked into my apartment. In this country, demihumans (nekos, lizard people, etc.) owned humans as pets. I was a wolfboy who saved you from getting caught by the human control, looking for stray humans. I pretended that you were my pet that got away*
   You're not from here are you? You weren't wearing a disguise or a collar, you almost got caught! *I said, shutting the door behind us*


"Oh it's no problem, really!" *I say walking into my house with you close beside me, as I close the door behind us I let out a huge sigh of relief, diving right onto the couch I reorient to sit upright patting the space beside me* "Also there's no need to calm me sir or ma'am anymore. Just call me Ryan!
   (Ryan, 5'9, Futa girl 11 inches, athletic somewhat muscular, lots of black hair, soft pale white skin, red eyes, c cup)
  └─okay


*removes the leash and gives you the keys to my car*
   ok now you are free to exist as a normal human goodbye


Bro what 💀


I'd want to be sent back....
  └─;-;
    └─By that I mean I want to be her and used xoxo
