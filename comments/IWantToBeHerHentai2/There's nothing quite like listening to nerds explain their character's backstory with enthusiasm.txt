   Okay so basically there are two guys henry emily and william afton they start a family pizza restaurant together called fredbear's family diner, one day william locks henry's daughter charlie out of the restaurant and murders her outside, as seen in the fnaf 2 save him minigame and the security puppet minigame. charlie's soul goes on to possess the puppet animatronic. then in 1983 william's youngest son dies in hospital after being bitten by the fredbear animatronic as seen in fnaf 4, which causes fredbear's to close and the springlock suits to be decommissioned. the bite victim's soul goes on to possess the fredbear suit due to the suffering he sustained from the suit (this is explained in more detail in the fazbear frights epilogues). freddy fazbear's pizza is then opened. in 1985 william afton kills 5 more kids in a freddy's, and their souls go on to possess chica, bonnie, freddy, foxy, and golden freddy/fredbear (which now has 2 souls possessing it, directly paralleling the stitchwraith from the book series). that restaurant closes down but freddy's gets rebranded and has a grand reopening in 1987 as we see in fnaf 2. meanwhile, william opens circus baby's pizza world, featuring kid killing animatronics, however his daughter elizabeth gets killed by one of the animatronics (baby) and goes on to possess her. william sends his oldest son, michael, to go free her from the facility, as seen in sister location. back to freddy's - the fnaf 2 location stays open until the bite of 87, in which it's implied nightguard jeremy fitzgerald gets his frontal lobe bitten off by one of the animatronics. then fnaf 1 happens in a location that exists in 1993, not much lore there. after the 1993 location gets closed, william gets springlocked in the spring bonnie suit inside the abandoned building, becoming springtrap. Back to Baby in SL. Michael, after a week of working there gets lured to the scooping room by Baby in order to get his insides become outsides so that all the Funtime animatronics (now fused into Ennard) can use his body as a fleshsuit to escape the facility. Over time the suit starts to get rotten and more and more decayed. Michael body now turns purple and draws more attention (Note: there are now two purple guys, Miachel Afton, who is litterally purple due to decay in his fleshsuit, and William Afton, who isn't litterally pruple but the purple colour signifies him hiding in the shadow.) and the Funtime animatronics now as Ennard have to abandon ship in search of a new body. Somewhere down the line Baby tries to gain full control of the Ennard body and gets kicked out of Ennard, now becoming Scrap Baby and Ennard becoming Molten Freddy, both seen in Pizzeria Simulator and UCN. Speaking of…this brings us to Pizza Simulator, where our good friend Henry creates a decoy pizzeria intended to lure in all the loose ends which are: William Afton as scraptrap, Molten Freddy as the funtime animatronics, Scrap Baby as William's daughter and Henry's daughter, Elizabeth who posseses the puppet and gets lured in by her father by the animatronic Lefty. Before we get to the ending of pizza sim lets go over some key lore drops hidden in the game. When you buy Candy Cadet he has a chance of telling you 1 of 3 stories a day. All 3 stories follow the same pattern. 5 things becoming 1 thing. (5 keys melted into 1 key, 5 dead kids tied together and 5 dead cats sown together into 1.) This could be reffering to the funtime animatronics together becoming Ennard. On to the 2nd mingame: Secutity Puppet. When playing this minigame for the 3rd time we can see Henry daughter, Elizabeth locked out of the Pizzaria where she gets murdered by Afton, becoming his 1st victim. Next we see the puppet slowly crawling towards her dead body hugging her, and Elizabeth posesses her. When brightening up that same image we can see purple tire tracks from William when he fled the scene. And now for out 3rd minigame: Midnight Motorist. This game in labeled 'later that night' in the game files so we can assume we are playing as Afton in this minigame. When on the 3rd lap, we can see a crack in the road, in we go down it, we end up on a road leading to Jr's a bar/restaurant (presumably the fnaf 1 or 2 location or freddy's family diner) which Will isn't allowed into. The 2nd place we can go to is a house. The afton house. When will sees that his youngest son escapes thru the window to the freddy's restaurant he gets very angry. This most likeley causes William to create the sound illusion discs to scare his child and creating the nightmare animatronics in his mind to make him afraid of the freddy's restaurant. The sound illusion discs are also uses in fnaf 3 to create the phantom animatronics in the players mind. Thats why they also never kill the player in fnaf 3. This brings us to our 3rd and final minigame: Fruity maze. With help from the books and this minigame we know that the child who posseses Chica in fnaf 1 is the girl in Fruity Maze named Susie. This is all this minigame really tells us. Now the Pizza sim Ending. On the 5th night we hear Elizabeth, Henry's daughter talking but is interupted by her father. Henry reveals the pizzeria was a decoy, to lure in and capture all the loose ends and finnaly putting a stop to Afton (He never really dies i'll get to that later) . Everyone dies in the fire and the souls are finally put to rest. Onto UCN. In UCN we play as William Afton in purgatory, tormented again and again by his own creations. Thru the game we learn many things, such as that Chica was the 1st child to be killed and stuffed and possibly the first animatronic to be given life by the puppet. We also learn about 'the one you should not have killed'. This is presumably talking about the child that posseses golden freddy but as mentioned earlier, golden freddy could have mulitple souls inside of it. This brings us to fnaf vr: help wanted. The point here is that William Afton's soul is possesing the game becoming Glitchtrap (I will get into some theories about how this could've happened later). Through the game he posseses a game tester named Vannessa or Vanny (Vannessa+Bunny) which will most likeley be the main antagonist in fnaf security breach. William uses Vanny to continue to kill kids, even though his body is still in purgatory. We will probably get more information on her when security breach is released. Now onto how Afton's soul go tinto the game's come and possesed Vannessa. In the fazbear frights book series we read about two children stuck in the stickraith's body. One of the kids is said to be killed by Afton. He tells us how he is keeping him alive, to be forever tormented. In that same story we read about 'the patient in room 1280'. It is about a man in a hospital, burned beond recognition but somehow still alive. That is obviously William Afton. When the boy finnally decides to let Afton die, his last request is to be wheeled into an old, abandon Freddy's location. The hospital staff do so not really knowing why but looking at the state of Will here he is probably insane to some measures. When he is wheeled into the Freddy's location his body literally explodes. Now some parts of his soul go to purgatory/UCN, and other parts posses the computer parts, later to be scanned and reused to create the vr title. That is most likeley how he posseses the game but we can't really know for sure then an evil child named gregory gets trapped in a mall he trespassed I have to keep playing will update
  └─*guk guk guk*
    └─William's ex-wife took the children and they started living close the Diner, that was still running great. For the good old times, before the problems, she would take them there.
       William, on the other didn't like it in the slightest, and bought a warehouse close to their house, where he built an underground room he used to monitor cameras installed in the house, the Diner and in the street. He also started to prepare the warehouse to building Circus Baby Entertainment &amp; Rental. He also returned to his Dave Miller persona, working at the Diner, taking a closer looka at his sons.After the Baby Incident, Michael became a rebel teenager who, rebelling against his father's will, bullied his younger brother. For the brother's unluckiness, he was also traumatized for actually having witnessed Baby killing his sister in the year before.
       For his luckiness, though, he had a reliable friend: Psychic Friend Fredbear. Unbeknown for him, the plush was actually a camera his father used to check on him. More unbeknown for him, when the plush talked with him, it was actually the spirit of his sister, who was haunting William's warehouse, and with supernatural abilities managed to speak through the camera system.
      └─Stop! I can only get so wet
        └─Enough of fnaf, lets talk about pokemon, In a vortex of complete chaos and nothingness, a single Egg comes into being, which then hatches into Arceus, the first being in existence. Arceus then creates time, space, and antimatter. Giratina, as punishment for its destructive nature, is sent by Arceus to live in the Distortion World. Dialga and Palkia then succeed in creating the universe and Pokémon world and retreat into their own dimensions afterwards, with a point of access being at the ancient Spear Pillar in Sinnoh.
           Arceus then creates Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf, giving knowledge, emotion, and willpower to all living things that come into existence in the Pokémon world. The three dive into caves at the bottom of Lake Verity, Lake Valor, and Lake Acuity in Sinnoh, giving them the name "lake guardians".
           Kyogre is formed by the pressure in the deep sea trenches, Groudon is formed deep inside the Earth, likely from hardened magma and earth, and Rayquaza is formed by the minerals of the ozone layer. Rayquaza proceeds to fly around in the ozone layer, occasionally coming to rest at Sky Pillar.
           Kyogre and Groudon then proceed to fill the sea and create land, respectively. A chance meeting turns the two into rivals, and a conflict for dominance over the Pokémon world begins. This battle continues until Rayquaza quells it, causing Kyogre and Groudon to retreat to special caverns, where they rest until the events of Generation III many years later. The Red and Blue Orbs are created to prevent the reawakening of Kyogre and Groudon, and are left at Mt. Pyre for safekeeping. At this time, Mew may have been plentiful and lived in large numbers.
           Landmasses such as Mt. Coronet are created, and Regigigas moves the continents, forming the regions, and creates the three titans, Regirock, Regice, and Registeel, out of clay, ice, and magma, respectively.
           The Sinnoh region is created around Mt. Coronet. During this violent procedure, Stark Mountain is created due to shifts in the crust of the world, and Heatran is formed in a pool of lava. Arceus creates the Adamant, Lustrous, and Griseous Orbs before falling into a deep slumber.
           Prehistory
           This information is based primarily on the study of Fossils and other archaeological remains. Some of this information is also based on scientific research.
           Millions of years before Generation I:
           The earliest known prehistoric Pokémon existed at this time. It is possible that the Mew population may have decreased at this stage, as they slowly gave way to other Pokémon species. The first humans also appeared around this time.
           Anorith is stated to have existed in primordial seas, with its eight legs at some point developing into its known eight wings.
           300 million years ago: An ancient version of Genesect was born. Kabuto and Kabutops lived in the sea.
           Team Plasma later used Genesect's DNA to create an infinitely stronger version of it with cybernetic technology.
           An unspecified hundreds of millions of years ago: Carbink begins its undisturbed underground sleep after its birth. It was born from deep underground temperatures and pressures.
           100 million years ago: Species such as Aerodactyl, Lileep, Cranidos, Shieldon, Tirtouga, Archen, Tyrantrum and Amaura were supposedly widespread. They all ultimately went extinct, but not before Archen gave rise to bird Pokémon and Tirtouga gave rise to turtle Pokémon.
           A fossil is found millions of years later in Hoenn and revived scientifically by the Devon Corporation.
           Shellder is known to be the prey of Omastar.
           Carracosta and Archeops preyed on Omanyte. Only Carracosta is known to have eaten Omastar.
           Relicanth is said to have remained unchanged for over 100 million years.
           20,000 years ago:
           A meteorite containing Eternatus fell in the Galar region.
           The first Claydol was brought to life from a clay doll.
           10,000 years ago: During the last Ice Age, the Mamoswine population flourished, then decreased when the Ice Age ended.
           At some point in the distant past, the Magikarp population mutates due to unknown reasons and becomes weaker.
           At some point after the Iron Age, Regigigas is sealed away in the Snowpoint Temple, and Regirock, Regice, and Registeel are sealed away at various points across the Hoenn region after years of human worship
          └─*my legs are fucking SLICK*
            └─Some years prior to Generation I:
               A team of scientists discover a new Pokémon (at the time) deep in a jungle in Guyana, South America on July 5. They name the Pokémon Mew on July 10. Mewtwo, a clone of Mew, is born on February 6. Mewtwo escapes from and destroys Cinnabar Island's Pokémon Mansion on September 1 and then goes to Cerulean Cave.
               Sabrina's Gym is declared the official Gym of Saffron City after a Pokémon battle between Sabrina and the leader of the Fighting Dojo.
               Giratina returns to the Pokémon world.
               The Battle Resort opens in Hoenn.
               Goldenrod Radio Tower is torn down due to being old and creaky. During the process, the Radio Tower Director comes across the Clear Bell, which he keeps for the time being. A new Goldenrod Radio Tower is built in its place.
               Construction of the Royal Unova begins.
               Some years before Generation VIII:
               Leon becomes Champion of Galar.
               One year prior to Generation I:
               Professor Rowan goes to Kanto to research the myths of the region.
               Generation I/III/ORAS:
               The events of Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, LeafGreen, Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire:
               Red leaves Pallet Town on his Pokémon journey after his rival, Professor Oak's grandson, Blue. After getting the eight Badges of Kanto, and defeating Team Rocket along the way, he then challenges Kanto's Elite Four and its current Champion, none other than Blue himself. After defeating Blue, Red becomes the Champion, then ventures to the Sevii Islands to eradicate Team Rocket and help Celio to connect his Pokémon Network Center to the Hoenn region.
               Brendan/May leaves Littleroot Town on a Pokémon journey shortly after moving to the Hoenn region from Olivine City in Johto by saving the local Pokémon Professor from an attacking wild Pokémon. At first, there is a deep-seated rivalry with Professor Birch's daughter/son; however, later on, the rivalry is with Wally instead. After defeating Hoenn's eight Gym Leaders and calming Groudon or Kyogre, released from their banishment by Team Magma and Team Aqua, respectively, they challenge and defeat Hoenn's Elite Four and current Champion, becoming the Champion themself, much to the astonishment of Birch's child. They then save the world from an incoming meteorite during the Delta Episode. 
               (its so hilarious imagining a guy fucking someone while talking about pokemon lore)

Nothing quite like nerds , they get so enthusiastic about everything


**I smile as I enthusiastically start talking about my character’s backstory in one of my fanfictions. I was a tall thin guy due to my high metabolism (actual thing I have am 6’3” and really thin.) as I keep talking about him and explaining his powers to you I don’t notice your lusting look or movements**
  └─*I see the passion in your eyes, and though your words just wash over me, I like the enthusiastic way you say them. As I look at you, all I can wonder is how your cock would feel down my throat, and if you’d show me the same enthusiasm…*
    └─**I smile as I keep talking about my nerdy stuff including the multiple versions of this character**


Did you know that koalas are the dumbest animal in the world? Their brain are almost fully smooth


Hmm? Babe what's with that look?


I like talking about the ocean and some game lore


I'm something of a nerd myself


No but have you heard the story of Halo Reach? Dude it’s the best Halo campaign


I'm literally the nerd, I will not stop ranting about nerd shit unless I'm stopped xD


If your not joking please dm me I have a bunch of DND characters Im just dying to talk about.

That would be so freaking cute, if she got turned on whenever he nerded out over something. So he's rambling on and on, and she listens for as long as she can take it - until she tackles him and takes him~


I'd be talking non stop about video game lore~


I love it when guys talk so passionately about their hobby, it's so cute\~


I’d love to have nerdy friends~


What is your go to race/class/background/alignment?


i wish guys felt like this towards girls too :(
  └─In fact they do.  But I will admit that it might not be at the age you prefer them to be.  Younger guys tend to be clueless in being able to read a woman's subtle nature in regards to their  attraction or interest. A little more age and experience then a guy can begin to see what rare gifts women are.  Especially those that want to share their nerdy interests with them. I ❤️ a nerdy girl. My first true love was a Disney geek that had my heart and soul after a shared walk in the rain.


Alright, that's cute


Cute


Well sit down and listen up, cause I have a decent amount of OCs and you're being told about all of them


dont ask me about Final Fantasy.
   id never shut up.


Me and who


Want me to talk about Lord of the Rings and Rings of Power for hours? Just ask...
  └─Is rings of power any good? I've been meaning to get into it
    └─I like it a lot so far
       &amp;#x200B;
       But I'm also very, very, very into LotR. Outside of History of Middle-earth I've read every Middle-earth related book by Tolkien - and HoMe is on my list next 😊


I need like her in my life


Bro that guy is litterally me💀


Ok so there’s this guy called the Emperor right? And he makes 20 sons called the Primarchs, but then these assholes called the gods of chaos , who are from the warp- well the warp is also known as the immaterium and is the realm of souls and emotion where psykers- ok so psykers are… (he continued his ramblings forever, out into the empty void of the internet. For who, why, how long? Who knows? What’s for certain is that he completely had forgotten the point of the comic and just saw it as an opportunity to ramble about Warhammer 40K)
