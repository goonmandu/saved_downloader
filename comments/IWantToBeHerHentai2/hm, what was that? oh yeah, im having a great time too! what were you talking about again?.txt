“so it all starts with William afton, and his buddy named Henry. Afton was a dad, had a daughter named Elizabeth, a son named Micheal, and an unnamed (probably had name, was just never brought up) younger child, of whom is known as crying child, due to his constant crying in literally any situation. Now Afton and his buddy were geniuses that somehow created machinery centuries ahead of its time (fnaf starts in the 1980-2000’s), and start a new diner of which had two functional kiddie entertaining robots, those being fredbear (a bear), spring Bonnie (a bunny), and the security puppet (a marionette).Considering the amount of restaurants that existed, they were pretty successful. now another thing to mention, is that Afton (and only afton) is also a psychotic murder, and murdered what is possibly his first kiddie victim, although maybe not, some voice lines in UCN prove that chica (Susie) was the first victim. But this is the first victim shown in game at least, maybe he killed Susie but only did (stuff that is spoiling to the plot later on) after animatronics were able to be used, with that out of the way, mofo killed his buddy Henry’s daughter for some damn reason, his actions may or may not have purpose, but yet again, that’s later. There definitely was security puppet, but the kiddies inside the diner had seemed to use her (probably the puppet’s gender) aesthetic design against her, stacking boxes on the giant present she peeks out of to check the area, of which she was able to push off, yet a bit too late considering the kiddies locked out Henry daughter (I forgor her name srry lol), of which gave afton a perfect time to kill. The puppet then went outside in search of her, of which it was raining, and since the puppet was an early design, water screwed her up, of which she broke down while laying near (Henry’s daughter) corpse, of which seemed to somehow get her to possess the puppet. Now I could be screwing this all up, and it may have happened in the revamped location which is until later, but my brain isn’t functioning properly considering it’s 2:48 AM rn and I am doing this from memory. With that out, now we go to crying child’s pov. He was severely bullied by his older brother of who would terrorize him with a mask of the future face of foxy, for no (yet) explained reason. Another thing to mention is he had an attraction to Fred’s, yet was also terrified by it, and would at times try to sneak into Fred’s without his father’s permission. He had some weird ass plush of faz bear that would talk to him in full length sentences To prevent this, Afton had the genius idea to use genius tech ahead of even modern times, on his child, and make him have horrific hallucinations/nightmares of the future Freddy gang, and of fredbear, to deter him from trying to go back there, and that fazbearbplush? It seemed to be controlled with a microphone or something that William would talk to him or something like that. this didn’t seem to work, and for some odd reason, Afton thought it would be a cool idea to also have his birthday party there. Micheal was also there, and with some of his own buddies, and they all had the great idea of grabbing crying child and put him inside of fredbear’s jaw so that he could “kiss him”, of which caused his frontal lobe to get bitten off, or something like that, and no, this is NOT the bite of 87, since it happened in the year 83(television showing the show “fred bear and friends” proves this). now, it is uncertain if crying child died or survived, and for a period of time it was considered that he was the protagonist we play as, of which is now false, but it seems to point towards him dying, and semi possessing golden Freddy. Now, another thing to mention is that his sister may or may not have died before him, but I am currently not functioning, and have no clue which goes first. After loosing a child, he promptly closed down the diner, but then also had the genius idea of opening a few more restaurants.” 
   “What are you looking at me like that? I was just explaining fnaf lore”
   (I’m so sorry)
  └─\*i nod along, having absolutely no idea what youre talking about\* no, its fine, keep going.... this is your first date, isnt it?  
     (i aint reading that lmao)
    └─(I saw the first few lines and immediately recognised it as the Jesse explaining FNAF lore copypasta and I’m losing my shit lol.)
      └─(OH MY FUCKING GOD IT IS!)
        └─(JESSE. YOU’VE DONE IT. YOU’VE SOLVED FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY’S!)
           (_Makes out aggressively_)
          └─(HAHA, YOU FINALLY FUCKING DID IT, YOU DID WHAT MATPAT COULDN'T DO JESSE)
            └─Haha yeah, I couldn’t help but use it, it was too funny for me to pass up.
              └─(You could've went further and did warhammer 40k lore)
                └─God, I don’t play those games but I don’t even want to try to sumerise that series.
                  └─(Pain to the highest level)
    └─“Ooookayyy” I say, giving a confused look before I continue. 
       “Now this is where I am uncertain about things, there seemed to be another location, but some stuff are screwing up my brain, yeah, srry. During or if not very closely after opening Fred’s diner, he opened another chain of restaurants, with the iconic Freddy gang that includes Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. Now he also murdered kiddies I’m this pizzeria, and instead of leaving the bodies back in an alley way, he had the luxury of putting corpses of children that decay, inside of entertainment robots, of which the puppet somehow caused them all to get possessed, and start acting aggressive to security guards, as they resemble their murder. It was closed down after the odor of decaying corpses became visible to the human nose. Then he decided to make yet another chain, and from the looks of it, it wasn’t he who did it, but his good ol pal Henry, with even crazier tech, revamping old designs, and causing an entire fan base horny for a chicken who resembles a human more than it’s respective animal, hence forth causing people to be semi furrys, yet not at the same time-ish? And the old animatronics were just tossed in the parts in service for no reason at all. now, Afton wasn’t just gonna let Henry play him that easily, and then created yet more crazy tech, with animatronics that can blow ballons with their fingers, and fucking ice cream aswell, the Funtime animatronics, of which he also specifically designed to kill kiddies and stuff their bodies inside themselves without his action. Specifically programmed to get kiddies who are by themselves, far from the crowd. Afton also prevented his daughter from coming in contact from the child’s dream, so she inevitably sneaked to the specific robot known as baby, of which she had to do so by being far from human contact, and got killed by baby, and none of the kids knew because they was in another room shouting and stuff. So the dumbass lost two kids to his own creations.” I continue my rambling, unaware of your thoughts toward me.
      └─you know, youre super cute when youre rambling...
        └─“I-I am?” I say, stopping my rant.
          └─yeah! its cute when you talk about your interests! even if those interests are nerdy as hell...
            └─(A blush on my face not a blurb)
            └─“T-thanks.” I say, slightly turning my head way from you, a blurb on my face. “I think you’re pretty cute too whenever you do…anything honestly.”
              └─aww, thats so sweet of you! \*i say as i pull you into a hug\*
                └─I let out a grunt of surprise as you hug me so tightly. I can feel your chest push up against mine. My blush starts to turn even redder.
                   “P-please don’t hug me too tightly. It can hurt.” I say, despite enjoying the gesture of affection.
                  └─oh, im sorry! i didnt mean to hurt you! \*i say as i reluctantly let go\*


“Did you know that there’s a whole theory that Bill Cypher from gravity falls is actually still alive? Ok, now wait, hold on! Before you say anything like, “Oh, he died. I saw”. Then let me tell you this!
   Grunkle Stan got hit with the memory wipe gun with Bill Cypher trapped in his mind, so it’s supposed to make you lose your memories permanently unless he gets reminded over and over about the things he tried to forget. 
   We see this same thing happen with Old Man McGuckett when he wipes his mind so much that he forgets Bill Cypher, what he saw in the portal, the journals, and everything revolving about the strange mysteries of the town. But when Dipper shows Old Man McGuckett the Secret Society of the Blind Eye, he starts remembering things! Patches of his memory soon start to come back in the show!
   Now, it is true that when Grunkle Stan got hit with the memory wipe, we saw his memory start getting destroyed by internal flames. This does kill Bill Cypher because he can’t escape the mind and doesn’t currently inhabit a body outside in the external world, thus making Bill Cypher’s real body inside Grunkle Stan’s mind…”
  └─\*i gaze at you, understanding absolutely nothing of what youre saying\*
    └─I look over at you and see you watching me. It seems like you're listening but not fully understanding what I'm saying based on the semi-blank look on your face. I'm not 100% sure though so I decide to ask you anyways.
       "Hey uh did I confuse something up for you? I feel like you're not fully understanding me unless I'm interpreting wrong", I say in a kind and gentle voice.
      └─oh, its fine.... youre cute when you ramble, you know that?


Did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, Captivate, Charm and Tail Whip along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close with this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat + high HP pool + Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.
  └─\*this particular topic seems to pique my interest a bit more as i listen intently\*
    └─The possibilities are endless with vaporeons. Their large thick tails can also be used for naughty times due to it's thickness and surprising flexibility it could be compared to a boa constrictor that means all the fun is in the front of the vap and with some training could fuck the vaporeon while it fucks you with its tail! We haven't even gone into what male vaps are capable of nor umbreons
      └─you know, my tail could probably do the same if you wanted\~
        └─I-I mean you could try. But upon closer inspection your tail is more fluffy and not as powerful as a vaporeons sure it could wrap around me and that would be... dangerous. I don't believe it has the strength for insertion either, no offense of course! You don't need to have a strong tail to be attractive or as some would say, "breedable".
          └─why would it be dangerous if my tail wrapped around you, hm?
            └─Ah! W-well you see, it could trigger some type of reaction! A uh, reaction that who's to say what type of reaction it could be bad? Or good? I-I don't know
              └─oh, wanna try it then?
                └─W-well, I'd be a fool to pass this opportunity up huh?
                  └─\*slowly, you feel it behind your back, pulling you closer to me\*


If only it would happen to me 😔
  └─[deleted]
    └─Then I get my dick sucked?
      └─[deleted]
        └─Well sometimes being unpolite is good
          └─[deleted]
            └─And ill try to not cum on your mouth to let you speak
              └─[deleted]
                └─Well I can do that. But I prefer to cum on girls faces. Its a little but hot detail, like ruined mascara
                  └─[deleted]


Anyways that's why I think that Phantom Blaster Diablo sp hit stamped are and should be more rarer than the base version since then the prices will go up. 270 out of the suppouse 500 copies, numbered and sent around the world were found and the remaining ones are in unopened boxes. That's why they should price PBD hot stamp more than A mint 10 Charizard. You still listening babe?
  └─oh, yeah! sorry, its just... youre really cute when youre rambling, you know?
    └─You think so babe? Well, thanks for finding me cute then... Anyways want me to talk about another topic? How about the lore of Warhammer 40k?
      └─sure! \*i say, my gaze drifting lower as you talk\*
        └─Nice, so where do I begin...
           *i clear my throat*
           So basically in 40k, It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor of Mankind has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods and master of a million worlds by the might of His inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the vast Imperium of Man for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day so that He may never truly die.
           Yet even in His deathless state, the Emperor continues His eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in His name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst His soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the Tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat to humanity from aliens, heretics, mutants -- and far, far worse.
           To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be relearned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.
           *i stop talking as I see your gaze go lower on my pants*
           Babe your still listening?
          └─oh, um, yeah.... sorry...
            └─*i go closer to you, cupping your face in my hand as I make your face go up to mine*
               Babe, I know you've been looking at my bone for a while, you can just say that you wanted it you know?
              └─but you were so cute, i didnt wanna interrupt you...
                └─*i go in and hug you kissing your head as I do it*
                   Your cuter babe. Just you zonign out while I explain geek stuff is cute.
                  └─awww, thats so sweet of you! \*i say as my tail keeps wagging\*


(I'm sorry but all the responses in here are so fucking funny especially the copypastas. However, to the Vaporeon breeding guy: how dare you /j)


Yeah the new trailer is awesome! See this is my favorite character ken, he used to be a family man but in this game he's divorced! I wonder what happened, I bet the story is awesome!...
   Oh sorry Im rambling again &gt;.&lt; I hope you aren't too bored
  └─no, no, its fine! dont worry, i like hearing your interests!
    └─Alright! \^-\^
       Check this out! This is my arcade controller that I built for the game! 
       *I take your hands and put them on the controller*
       To do a special move, turn the stick in a quarter circle like this! It takes some practice, here let me show you:) *holding your hands and playing with the controller, laughing and enjoying being with you*
      └─thats really not the kind of "joystick" that im used to, but it seems fun! you really built this?
        └─Yep! I ordered the arcade buttons from Japan, the case on Etsy, and wired it all up!
           What kinda joystick did you mean? *My hand brushes against your thigh since we are sitting so close*
          └─\*my hand trails down your body, resting over your crotch\* this one\~
            └─O-oh! *I finally picked up on all your signals from when I was lost in my rambles*
               Show me how you like to play with this one, then
              └─there we go\~! someone is finally excited\~ \*i say as i rub you through your pants\*
                └─My cock starts to get harder. 'ha.. yes.. excited....'
                   I put my arm around you, looking down at your adorable eager face. You look so happy that it makes me smile. I lean in and kiss you, and as you keep rubbing me I involuntarily thrust my dick into your hand a little
                  └─\*i giggle a little as you thrust, speeding up a little\*


So yeah, that's the whole plot of Darkest Dungeon... why you looking me with that funny face? And your tail sure is wigglin fast
  └─sorry! i just really like hearing about your interests! youre so cute when you ramble...
    └─*I blush* Aaw... that's really nice of you... thanks... nobody never listens to me... so it's pretty cool you do
      └─oh, of course! im always happy to listen, im so sorry other people dont...
        └─It's fine I'm used to it... but I'm glad to have you around now! *I smile*
          └─\*i return your smile, still gazing at you\*
            └─*I look away blushing a bit*
              └─aww, whats wrong?
                └─N-nothing... is just that... you're really nice... and cute
                  └─\*i blush a little too, giggling\* aww, so are you!


One explanation for why smell sense memories are so enduring and strong is that the olfactory bulb is one of the few places in the human brain known to have continued neurogenesis into adulthood.  
   (this is a powerful pic/situation, though, for real)
  └─\*i nod along, not understanding half of your words\*

"Yeah, so really..." -He kept on rambling about Shakespeares most famous work, Romeo and Juliet and wasn't minding her staring-
  └─\*i nod along, only really listening as you describe their night together, but enjoying your excitement anyway\*
    └─-He soon stopped and chuckled- "S-sorry, you must be getting bored of my rambling..."
      └─no, im not bored at all! youre really cute when you ramble...
        └─"You sure? I don't wanna make it seem too annoying for you to put up with..."
          └─of course! i dont mind at all!
            └─"Well... what do you want to do now? You seem like you have something planned"


"You see, people call him trash but in reality he's a character that people don't take the time to learn so they play poorly whenever they use him. If they took the time to give him a good build and learn his kit then they would see that he's actually borderline broken, but most people can't or won't bother because they listen to everything they see or hear on the internet-"
   I ramble, losing myself in my own world
  └─\*i dont stop you, gazing at you, my eyes full of both love and lust\*
    └─*I keep on rambling until finally, I notice you staring at me strangely*
       "H-hey, you okay there? You're giving me this weird look..."
      └─oh, yeah, im fine! just.. thinking...
        └─*I look at you worriedly* "Are you okay? Do you wanna talk about it?"
          └─oh, im more than ok.... youre really cute when you ramble, you know that?
            └─"W-wha-" *I stammer, trying to figure out what to say* "I-I u-um..."
              └─\*i giggle as i see your flustered reaction\*
                └─"Don't tease me, hmph" *I pout as I notice you giggling*
                  └─awww, sorry... you just looked so adorable being all flustered like that!


im telling you the book is good!!
  └─oh, yeah, im sure it is! ill have to read it sometime!


I wish someone would listen to my nerdy ramblings ;-;


"In terms of sheer graphics power the rtx 4090 is a step up from the previous series but honestly? It's not worth the 1600 dollar price tag as the previous generation outperforms in terms of performance per dollar while not being able to draw as much power as this newest generation. These new cards are getting so insane in terms of power draw that some people are speculating that you'll eventually need a dedicated electrical circuit just to power them if you have a high end cpu that draws a lot of power too and-"
    
   I stop, cheeks flushed in embarrassment
    
   "Sorry about that I'm just really into talking about computer stuff! I think it's super cool stuff personally but I'm rambling..."
  └─no, i dont mind! i dont really understand any of it, but its really cute to see you so excited about something!
    └─"I- oh... well I..."
        
       *I stammer over my own words for a bit, my cheeks burning a deep red*
        
       "Thank you... for just being willing to listen to me. There's not many people out there like you and I appreciate it a lot."
        
       *I smile shyly at you*
      └─\*i return your smile, wrapping my arms around you\*
        └─*I blush even harder as you wrap your arms around me, instinctively leaning into your hug*
            
           "I- thank you so much miss, I really appreciate it..."
            
           *My smile grows a bit wider*
          └─of course! thank you for telling me about your interests!
            └─"No really, I should be thanking you. Most people just make an excuse to leave because they don't wanna listen but you stayed. It's just really touching for a guy like me."
              └─its really nothing! a good girlfriend should care about what you care about!
                └─"W-wait girlfriend? I didn't realize you liked me like that..."
                    
                   *I bury my face in my hands for a moment before looking back at you*
                    
                   "Well if we're gonna be a couple then y-you should talk about something you care about too... it's not fair if I'm the only one who gets to ramble!"
                    
                   *I look up at you, blushing but with interest in my eyes*
                  └─wait, you didnt realize? this is like our 3rd date! how  did you not!


“So basically to dumb down the plot of  the game. A human named frisk climbs up a mountain and falls into a cave, and is the start of the game. *Blah blah blah blah blah* so after defeating Asriel dreemurr and freeing every monster in the underground, frisk then destroys the barrier that keeps them there and they all exit the underground and live on the surface. The end.” I say after ranting for an hour.
   “You weren’t listening where you?”
  └─oh, no, i definitely was! i didnt really understand most of it, but thats ok... youre really cute when you get like that, you know....
    └─“Ahhaha…thanks…” I say nervously as my face turns completely red.
       “Nobody really listens to me so I’m kinda nervous. Especially because I’m talking to a pretty girl like you.” I say without even realizing.
      └─\*i blush a little\* im really not that pretty...
        └─“Sure you are. You’re beautiful” I say as I walk over to you and put my hands on your shoulders.
           “If I’m being completely honest. I was thinking about becoming more than just friends with you.” I say nervously as our faces somehow get even redder.


Hey uh- you alright? You haven't said much- wait was I rambling again?
  └─oh, its fine! i dont mind, youre cute when you ramble!
    └─O-oh um thank you! But really I insist on letting you talk, its rude to not let the other party speak isn't it?
      └─well, thats very sweet of you\~!
        └─Well lets hear it, what do you want to say or talk about, feel free to make any remarks about what I talked about or jokes, cmon I've heard it all


Girls like it when we ramble about things we like? Holy shit is this true?
  └─its true for me at least
    └─There’s hope!


I desperately need a girl like this girl


"Okay, so Jurassic Park gives the wrong impression about dinosaurs and it bugs me. First of all, there are *so* many inaccuracies with the species they portrayed...(*something about Dilophosaurus being much bigger and not spraying venom*...also, (*something about how T. rex's wrists were broken in the movie, and how they should be oriented inward*). Oh man, and the worst of them all... (*something about Velociraptor being way smaller and how it should covered in feathers, and more bird-like than lizard-like*).
