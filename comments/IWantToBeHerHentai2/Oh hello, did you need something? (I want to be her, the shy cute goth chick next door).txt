"....O-oh yea right, i wanted to ask if you got some flour? I miscalculated and I'd would be a shame to throw everything away ehehe" i say scratching embarrassed behind my head
  └─*I hum, thinking before turning to head to the kitchen*
     I think I do.,.
    └─*i hum lightly a familiar tune as i wait for you*
      └─*I come back with a whole bag*
         Here…
        └─Thanks a lot
           *I say with a very wide smile and taking the bag, heading off to my apartment.
           A few hours later your doorbell rings again*
          └─*I open it again with a huff*
             Yes?
            └─Heya neighbor ^^
               *I hold up a bag of cookies and the remaining flour*
               Got your share, feel like sitting down and eating some?
              └─Um sure…wasn’t expecting this…
                └─Oh? What were you expecting?
                   *I ask questioning as i follow you inside, looking around and getting a slight blush as i see your bed directly against the wall facing my apartment, remembering some...sounds ...*
                  └─Nothing at all….
                     *I sit, waiting for you with my hands in my lap*
  └─Queue "The only thing I know for real"
     Sam appears

  └─Um no thanks…
    └─Are you sure…? I’m happy to help if you want any
      └─Well I’m not up to anything right now
        └─Well would you like to go to the shopping district? I need to go buy a few things if you wanna tag along
          └─I don’t have anything better to do
            └─Great! Well first I have to buy some food. What do you want to eat?
              └─Um…burgers?
                └─Sounds good! I’ll pay it’s my treat for you coming along
                  └─Thanks I guesss


Oh yeah I was just wondering if you wanted to come over to my place later tonight. We could order pizza or something. *I say nervously expecting to get rejected because of how pretty you are*
  └─*I brush my hair*
     Um sure I guess, have nothing better to do
    └─Oh wait really! Th-thanks I honestly didn’t think you’d say yes. *I blush because I never thought I’d get this far*
      └─*I tilt my head.*
         Um
         You’re welcome
        └─*Embarrassed I change the subject* Uh i um guess I’ll see you later. How does 9 sound?
          └─Sure, works well for me
            └─Alright bye then. *I walk to my house next door fist pumping in excitement* (Time skip) *Its approaching 9 and I’m excited and nervous* I hope she actually comes.
              └─*I sigh, gently knocking on the door*
                └─*I jump up and go to grab the door but show restraint after a few seconds I grab the door and open it* Hey there how are you. Come on in, the pizza should be here soon.
                  └─Thank you I guess…
                     *I step inside*


“Oh hey. I’m your new neighbor. Just wanted to introduce myself” I say as I check you out a bit and blush “and you’re a cutie”
  └─Oh…hello…
    └─“Do you wanna hang out tonight? We can probably order some food and play a hand or something” i smile lightly at you
      └─Sure don’t have much to do..
        └─“Will you be ok? If not we can hang out when you feel much comfortable”
          └─It’s fine
            └─I start to enter your apartment and I sit down on the couch as I start to order us a pizza
              └─*You notice a ton of different types of art and artwork on my walls*
                └─I look around and was curious if you’re the one who did all this
                  └─*I hum, turning around to get something*


Um, hi! I'm Jake, your new neighbor!
   So I guess this is kind of embarrassing, but well... I was making pumpkin pie because you know, 'tis the season. And um... I sort of forgot that I don't have any ground cinnamon. So I was...kind of wondering if you had some that you could spare?
  └─Luna and I have some…
     *I turn, showing off my butt as I walk to grab my cinnamon, returning a bit later*
    └─*I can't help but blush upon seeing your butt, but I look away to be respectful*
       Oh, thanks so much! In return, well...would you like to come over for some pumpkin pie?
      └─Sure, are you fine with my dress? Or should I change?
        └─O-oh, it's fine! You um...look really cute, actually..
           *I pause for a moment, silently cursing myself for being so straightforward*
           Ahem, anyway. So if you're ready to come over, I can take you back to my place. I'll finish up the pie and maybe we can watch a spooky movie or something?
          └─Yeah sure and thanks…
            └─Alright, sweet!
               *I lead you to my apartment, just next door to yours. I open the door and you are greeted by a jack-o-lantern, cobwebs, and the smell of pumpkin spice. I laugh nervously, realizing how embarrassing this might be*
               Haha, yeah. I um...kinda like Halloween. So uh, would you be more interested in just a spooky movie or some actual horror? Let's see here, I've got Corpse Bride, Alien, The Ring...
              └─Alien is perfect!
                 *i clap my hands, excited hearing the title*
                └─Ayyy good choice! That's one of my favorites!
                   *I give you a little smile. I don't say it, but I think: "She's so adorable!"*
                   Okay, feel free to take a seat and I'll start it for you while I get baking!
                  └─*I smile back, walking over the the couch*


Hi, I’m really sorry to bother you but my pet gecko escaped through the air conditioning vent into your apartment. Do you mind if I try and find him?

Yes, I'm in need of your assistance immediately.


Dm me if still available


*I stood on your front porch, wrapping the bathrobe around myself slightly tighter.* Hey... this is an awkward way to introduce myself. I went out to get the paper... and I guess I locked the door on the way out... 
   *I felt so embarrassed in this moment, locked out of my house in only a bathrobe. And here I was, having to ask my cute new neighbor for help*
