*You were laying on my bed, focusing entirely on the game. I smirked and walked up beside you, touching your back just beside the base of your tail.*
  └─*i Yelp, blushing as I arch my back*
     What the hell roomie?
    └─Hey, don't blame me because you're not paying attention. *I said, laughing a bit at your reaction.* How long have you been playing that game nonstop? Were you on it the whole time I was at the store?
      └─No….
        └─*I looked at you skeptically, holding out my hand.* C'mon, you need to have a break. Would you want to go walk around the park with me?
          └─*I huff and hold my phone close*
             No! I don’t want to!
            └─C'mon, it's a beautiful Saturday outside and you're just going to spend it on video games. What about we go swimming? *I offered an alternative, trying to find something you'd want to do*
              └─Nope!
                 *I roll over*
                └─What would you want to do? I'm not above bribing you. *I said, rolling my eyes about how stubborn you were being*
                  └─With what?

“I-I’m sorry I thought you heard me call from the other room hahah, what are you up to anyway?”
   *I sat down on the bed next to you, my hand now moved away from your back after spooking you but my hand grazed your tail as I pulled away*
  └─*I arch my back in reaction, my tail swishing in the air*
    └─“A-ah I’m sorry I-I didn’t mean to touch your tail! U-Um maybe this will help”
       *I gently placed my hand on your head and slowly started to pat and rub your head and ears, trying to calm you down*
      └─*I frown, blushing*
         You should be careful…besides this is kinda stereotyping me..
        └─“Uuuh I-I’m sorry…I’ve never met a cat girl before so I’m not sure what I’m doing…I’m sorry if I offended you..”
           *I moved my hand away from you and scooted further away on the bed from you*
          └─Fox..I’m a fox…
             *I look almost annoyed and amused*
            └─“S-shit I’m sorry…I’m an awful roommate…I-I’ll just leave you alone”
               *My head immediately sinks and I slowly stand up from the bed and start walking towards the door feeling like I’ve just offended you with everything I’ve said*
              └─*I snort and laugh*
                 It’s not that serious,you didn’t know
                └─*I don’t say anything and leave the room, I open the door to my room walk inside and immediately face plant my bed in shame*
                   “I’m such a moron…”
                   *I mumble to myself muffled by the pillow currently in my face*
                  └─*I roll my eyes, and get up to follow you*

*id finally get home after a long day of work and notice you in your room door wide open and not wearing pants.
   Thinking it would be funny id then quietly tip toe my way in before gently rubbing my hand up your thigh, over your ass with a little squeeze before eventually ending up slowly stroking your tail as I smile*
