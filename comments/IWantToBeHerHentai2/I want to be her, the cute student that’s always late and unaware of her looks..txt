I sit outside the hall, as the usual early person I wait outside for the door to be opened. though it was strange to see the girl who was always late run past me and hit the door thinking it was open. "Dude you ok?"
  └─*I rub my forehead*
     Ah..no…
    └─*"*Wow, this is the first time you've been early.. guessing from the way you slammed into that door, you thought you were late..?"
      └─*I pant, hands on my knees as my clothes are disheveled*
         Yeah…I did…ah…
        └─"well I guess we now know how to make you wake up early!" I say in a joking tune before helping you up.
          └─“Not funny…ahh…”
             *I fall on the ground, too tired to try to stand up*
            └─"Sorry, you're just infamous for being late.." *It sit down next to you and patted your back.*
              └─“Shut it…”
                └─"Yea.. I guess you've got a few hours to wait then.."
                  └─*I sigh, unbuttoning the cardigan due to the heat, my shirt underneath see-through with my sweat*
                     Ah…this feels weird being early


*As the class representative, I had to keep a record of all students….and one girl was particularly late consistently. Seeing as your an through the door, I let out a sigh*
   You again…?
  └─*I pant, holding the door open*
     Yes…I’m here…
    └─*Massaging my temples, I’d have a strict look on my face. Sure, it was free study this period….but the teachers have been giving me an earful for not keeping you in check*
       I told you not to be late again….so why did the bell ring half an hour ago?!
      └─Umm….I was in traffic?!
        └─Traffic…sure! You’ve made the same excuses, and your parents never backed that up when the teachers asked! I’m sure you were just sleeping in late….
          └─*i blush*
            └─*As I was going off, I was only rambling so much because of your looks….you were seemingly out of breath, but your face…looked lewd*
               W-well….if you understand, then don’t let it happen again! And stay here after classes, alright!
              └─*I pout, frowning*
                 F-fine…
                └─*As the bell rings, letting out class, I’d wait at the door, the teacher and students all leaving until it was us two alone*
                   Hahhh….so, let’s hear it….your actual reason for being late? You seemed to run hard…..with this….disheveled clothes
                  └─*I frown*
                     I was late…no reason..


*I'm the guy that always ends up seating behind you and after you sget yelled at by the teacher and sit down on your seat I try to make small talk* I gotta give it to you today you weren't even that late it's only been 2 minutes since the class started
  └─*I groan*
     Still late…
    └─It's not late at all, there should be a rule that gives us at least 5 minutes to enter the room like for god's sake I live 3 hours from him and tomorrow it could very well into a 5 hour drive *I grab a strand of your beautiful hair, playing gently with it* have I told you how beautiful your hair is?
      └─Ah…that’s nice…he always yells at me
        └─If you need to let something out I'm in no position to judge, vent all of your frustrations on me so you can enjoy the rest of the day

   i say with a sigh as i place some papers on my desk
  └─Why?…

      └─I’m not!!!
        └─miss i cautght you stareing at my twice today so you better explain yourself
          └─I was thinking about something else
            └─like what exactly

              └─My sister?
                └─your sister? and what about your sister is so important you cant get to class on time?
                   *i say with a raise eyebrow*
                  └─She’s sick? In the hospital?


*I sit next to you at the back of the class and move my chair closer to you.* Hey, you doin okay? *I whisper.*
  └─Um yeah?
     *I whisper back, confused*
    └─You sure? I noticed you've been coming in late looking like you just got hit by a bus.
       *I point to your messy and sweaty head*
      └─It’s…nothing….
        └─C'mon, I'm not an idiot. Is it something you need serious help with?
           *I put one of my hands on your knee as I scoot closer*
          └─It’s my ex…
            └─What's happening?
               *I ask with a bit of concern in my voice. We're practically rubbing shoulders as I try to comfort you*
              └─Just..like harassing me
                └─Do you want some help getting rid of him? Or just avoiding him till he goes away?
                  └─Maybe just stay somewhere for a bit

(I fixed the pose due to spelling errors.)


**I sigh and tell you** “After class you are staying here and helping me clean while explaining why the hell you’ve been late every day this week alone.” **I point to your seat and tell you to take a seat** “Take a seat and then I will begin the lesson.”
  └─*I pout, frowning as I sit down*
    └─**I sigh and pinch the bridge of my nose** “Alright today we’re going over the history and science behind metallurgy and how we as humans couldn’t live without that vital technology today.” **I then start explaining it going back to the Bronze Age where the people would smelt copper and lead to make proto-bronze though that was dangerous due to lead being toxic to us** “Later on we found Tin and that’s when we made the Bronze that we know today.”
      └─*I lay my head down, taking a nap*
        └─**I throw a piece of chalk at your head to wake you up at the end of class and then close the door and lock it** “You wanna explain why I have to keep telling you to be on time to my class and not take a fucking nap!?” **I was pissed off because you were the worst student in my class** “And don’t think I didn’t notice you sneaking glances at my crotch either.” **I was tall and muscular and everyone knew that I was a blacksmith when not teaching the subject that was known as scientific history**


*I bump into you, finally this is my chance to talk to you after all this time*
   Ohh haha uhh you're late too? S-same uhmm funny aye?
   *My eyes drifting from your face to your body, to your face again, very awkward and nervous*


You’re late again huh.. I’ll share notes don’t worry


Hot


*whispers* As your best friend, you should keep your legs closed.... I think you forgot something as you where running late.


\*I'm usually the guy who sits next to you in class and as usual I inform the teacher you are late again, not surprised one bit\*


You will stand in the hall till after class and then you will stay after school.
