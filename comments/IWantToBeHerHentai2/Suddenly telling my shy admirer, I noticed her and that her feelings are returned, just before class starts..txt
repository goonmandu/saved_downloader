“Oh um h-hi” I say moving back slightly as you come closer. I feel my butt press against the desk as you stand over me looking into my eyes
  └─“You are so cute.” I say softly. I get a little close looking in your eyes.
    └─Oh I I’m I ahhhhh I let out a cute sqeak
      └─I press up against you, “am I a little too close?” I ask softly. I look at you still smiling.
        └─Um a L-L ahh eeeeep
          └─“Your so cute!” I get excited, guess that means no close enough. I press ever so gently against you feeling your body tremble but press back against mine. “You still interested in a direct dominant girl?” I ask as I get close enough for a kiss.
            └─I blush ahhhh I yes please I squeal
              └─“that is what I like to hear.” I hold you closer in a hug. I let time pass enjoying you in my arms.
                └─I calm down a little as you hold me resting my head on your shoulders
                  └─I hold you tightly and sway a bit. You feel really good in my arms.


“I-I… what do y-you mean?” *I squeak when you suddenly tell me. I hadn’t even noticed how close you got to me, jumping when you spoke. I was such a cute little thing, being the shortest girl in our class by a bit.*
  └─I noticed since for a long time I kiss your forehead and sit for class and wink at you smiling.


[removed]
  └─“I think you know” I smirk, I give you a gentle kiss as I start to get even closer.
    └─[removed]
      └─I like you, so we are going on a date after. I gently push you against your desk. I made the other girl switch. We are going to be beside each other now. I adjust your hair, there now you look amazing.
        └─[removed]
          └─I take my hand and turn you back to me. “I noticed and I decided to take the first step” i say as, I smirk playfully, I kiss you as the bell rings and people come in.
            └─[removed]
              └─“I want them to see” I kiss you softly making you forget for as everyone now knows. I smile gently at you looking at your shyness.
                └─[removed]
                  └─I hold you hand as I speak louder”ofcourse, I will go on a date with you, your so cute !” I look excited and sit next to you knowing I just embarrassed you but I am sincerely happy to go on a date.


"uh....a..are you ok....why are you so close to me..?
  └─“I am perfect, don’t you agree?” I tell you softly asserting myself closer. I gently smile tho.


I-Im s-sorry! I j-just find you att-attractive, i'll stop *blushing intensely i have a hard time with my words as you're so close to me*
  └─I get even closer you smell my slight perfume and I adjust your hair. I look gently at you. “What are you going to stop?” I ask directly and firm.
    └─*blushing harder as i feel your soft hand touching my cheek for less than a second, i try to back up down more but im blocked by the table*   
       "N-Nothing s-sorry" *not being able to look you in the eyes, i just look down*
      └─I follow you and press gently against you. I put my hand against your face and slowly turn your head. “I have a super crush on you” I firmly tell you, you feel confidence in me as I speak.
        └─*Hearing your words i stay silent, processing what you just said to me, the girl i was lusting for so long telling me she liked me too, after looking back at you i let a single tear out before getting closer to you and hugging you*
          └─I wipe that tear away. I hold you gently and firm. I lose track of time holding you.
            └─*mumbling through my tears i say in a low voice*   
               "I-I like you too..."
              └─“I am happy we are like this” I whisper. I don’t even notice class has started. I am just enjoying you in my arms. I smiling looking out the window in happiness
                └─*seeing everyone around us i feel embarassed, removing myself from your embrace i run away feeling so bad about the show i gave going in a corridor with mixed feelings, happy to be able to tell you my feeilings and embarassed from crying in your arms*
                  └─I wait a little then join you. I just stand close waiting


*my cheeks were flushed red from embarasment, my butt pressed against the table as you stood in front of me* "U-umm excuse me? D-did I hear you correctly?"
  └─“What did you hear?” I push my body firmly closer and  smile close to you. “I am wearing my special perfume just for you, do you like it?” I tell you softly.
    └─*I shyly nod, looking away from you in embarrassment* "Y-yeah... I-it smells nice..." *I say, my hands starting to quiver from nervousness*
      └─I press against you and I hold you hand. “I am not trying to trick you” I am interested in shy girls a lot. I smile sincerely.
        └─"... R-really...?" *I ask in slight shock, breathing heavily. The only other time I had been asked out by someone it was just a prank, so I was naturally sceptical.*


Ahhh I would be sooo flustered and not knowing what to do&lt;3
  └─I would find that so attractive. I just standing before class not noticing you coming in early too. I thinking about how busy I am today and look slightly stressed.

All I can do is let out a squeak as my face instantly turns bright red. "Y-you like me?" My legs go so weak I have to grab on the desk to stay standing as you push up so close to me. Your body, and soft lips... just a few inches from mine.


This is so so so so so cute, anyone want a girl?


Twins?


Omg I'd absolutely melt and be extremely flustered if a girl pinned me down like this and confessed she liked me too &gt;*&lt;


W-what do you mean? H-how did you know? I've never told anyone about my c-crush


Oh lord I’d turn bright red 😳


‘AAAAA SO CUTE!!‘ *I scream internally. My heart feels overloaded, my head goes dizzy. I feel like I’m out of breath, and with class about to begin, my mind is spinning.* 
   “E-Eeh?! Really?!”
   *My eyes drift from yours, down your body, before staring at my feet. My face burns with embarrassment, and slowly that warmth begins to seep and spread throughout my body~*
